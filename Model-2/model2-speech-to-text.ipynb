      "Doorbell right now. Okay sounds good. Yes. I'm okay. I'm from here originally los angeles. I like the weather. And my family's here which is. While i'm here i have moved away for awhile. I like that there's a lot of. Call even though everyone says there's no culture in la there is a lot of culture there's. Theater and film and lots of museums and things like that all different kinds of people i like the diversity. Well i don't like that. I had to move back kinda pretends to my will so starting a new career. Starting over in my career. It's not really something. Play move back as my dad was sick. So. Thank you. That's why i'm here but it also means i live with my dad and my brother who are like hoarders and ridiculous. Acting. Here. Hey i am. I'm an actor right now i'm doing a. A theater show and auditioning and taking some classes. Surfing. Well my parents are both. Rc people and i grew up around it and for a long time i was singing and then i was went to study musical theater. And somewhere along the line they realized it acting was more my. Bag then singing i suppose but i still do both. Now i don't. I don't usually have trouble talking to people i'm pretty friendly. I can get along with most people people usually tell me their secrets within 5 minutes of meeting me how much i feel like is. Mark of an extrovert. I took a bath or read a book. Go out to my friends. Go to the theater. Sometimes my work is very relaxing so sometimes just like singing a song or. And you thought going for a walk. Yoga. Things that make me mad. Injustice. I can be very righteously indignant i suppose. People who don't see those things and people who have like entitlement i think entitlement and sense of privilege. That can make me mad. Yeah. It depends i usually a lot of times it's. I argue my case i guess. Alright i call my best friend usually and complain. Talk to her about it. Pretty good. Pretty good i don't have too much of a temper. Like a real argument or like a debate. If it was a real argument probably would be my. Ex-boyfriend. And we just argued about why we broke up stupid things like that. I think i was kind of. Over it by then but. Was it *. I feel really happy. Was. Really happy. Probably hanging out hanging out with friends the other night had a good time. My best friend would describe me as an open-book she often makes fun of me for like just. Telling everyone everything. Describe me as. Compassionate. And. Having a strong sense of who i am. I think. Yeah she also she would describe me as not having like a good sense of social norms sometimes probably something that she. Make fun of me for. Because i do just like tell everyone everything and. Don't realize that i have like holes in my clothes and things like that but nothing. I think that we were very good relationship. Yeah yeah it has it's not terrible trouble but. But yeah it's got me in trouble before sir. Abbott. No but i think i had it. But i never went to doctor. Cuz i had a i had a traumatic situation. H somebody injured me. And i. When i looked up ptsc later i realized i felt like i had all of the symptoms of like. Going back in a situation like that i would get panicky and it was very. I held onto it for a really really long time. I think. I think that i did had it but i just i don't know cuz i never i never saw anyone about it. Sometimes yeah. Certain physical things with that part of my body can be a trigger. Or. It happened in a in an acting class. So sometimes certain teachers. If they. Criticize in a certain way. I start to i start to panic even if they're totally right and i know they're right and like. It's something that. Someone else could tell me and i'd be fine with it sometimes it'll make me a little upset or panicky. No. Well i mean my dad is sick so. Not great. But but considering not terrible. I've been having bad dreams. Apps like stress dreams i think having to do with my dad. They getting kidnapped and my teeth falling out things that if you look them up always say like there's something out of your control just like exactly what it is so. It's not the best but it's just dreams at least so. Which way. Easy. Crazy. I am tired and irritable goofy. I get really goofy. Yeah. I. And fairly non judgemental. Other people like i stay open-minded. You make most people laugh funny. Creative. I. That is some of the best ones i'd say. Yeah. I love meeting new people and seeing new things and learning. And just getting out of the routine i like staying in hotels. I like most things about traveling i even i even like flying i like all of it. Well i just finished a tour a couple months ago. Going up and down the east coast and then across the u.s. send. Performing for kids all over. Yeah and then we ended up here in la. Yeah yeah it was great as a good time. Anything qui. We went to. The hot springs the naturally occurring hot springs in colorado and that was really nice was a nice way to unwind. A lot of people i i would say. I need my dad comes to mind certainly. My godmother. Is a huge positive influence in my life as well. My best friend my best friend from high school i think i have a few of my best friends from high school. I'm in college. I kind of grown up with and. Become who i am. With them. Small things. Sure. I regret. The way that i dealt with. A friendship that was ending once i regret. Committing to certain people that have dated. But nothing huge i tend to. Go well i won't do that again but i don't spend a lot of time. Like being upset about things i've done in the past. Stand up for yourself. Don't date felons. I think that i. I don't have any trouble standing up for things that i believe in. But sometimes i have trouble standing up for myself. I think i i. Really internalized the idea of like. You know women being too needy or. I don't know those kinds of things and then and so as as an adolescent and growing up i felt like well you didn't you just shouldn't need anything or you're needy and it took me awhile to be able to like a voice what i want what i needed from other people and be okay with that. I'm so can i work on. I'm glad you think so. Silly question. My friends and family. And. I my talents. I would say. Yeah. Yeah my ability to take situations and. Take bad situations and continuing. Make the best of everything. Alright. Thank you. Goodbye goodbye. \n",
      "So where's my little button. Are you bringing okay alright. Okay. Alright. You're welcome. Yes. Today is a wonderful day i'm doing just absolutely. I was born in cleveland ohio i was raised in tucson arizona and came to los angeles when i was 16 years old. Yes. I've only been back once. Since i left. The whole nother. Community. When i was growing up i'm so glad i grew up there because it was a great sense of community. Which i could we don't have it in my friend. My grandmother died and left property for my father. So we came here to manage her property property. It was pretty easy for me i was still young. When was egypt said that. So i'm pretty good at meeting people. That has never been a problem i traveled a lot as a child. Tyler's used. Moving. Going to new places. Meeting new people seeing new things it's an adventure and i like the adventurous life. Oh one of my best trips i had it was in. 19 i'm dating myself but 1964. I came out here to visit my grandmother from cleveland. Ohio. And i went to an indian reservation. And i got a little note card about the reservation when i got back home i wrote to the reservation and i told him i when i went back to school in september i would have to write. Deliver a speech rather about what i did over the summer and i told them i wanted to. Talk about going to the indian reservation and what they send me something. And they sent me this huge. Kachina indian.. And that was that was a wonderful experience to have the thing is worth now if i still had it. I found out like a quarter of a million dollars. But that's one of the best prison. I can be a little bit of both. I'm pretty when i have to be i can be outgoing cuz i'm good at talking to people and meeting people but sometimes i have a little bashful side-by-side me to so so little bit of both. I study business administration. With a precision marketing and advertising. Really i started in computer science but that was back in the day when computer-science wasn't is what it is today. And i'd like i was good at it but it wasn't any interaction with people and i love people. So i wanted something that would bring me. Interaction with people so i wouldn't a marketing. And i was working for a tv station where i was going to school so. That fit in line and marketing advertising. No now i'm a photographer i'm a celebrity photographer. I shoot a lot of stars. I shoot on the red carpet. I shoot a lot of special events and anything else people will pay me for. It's not hard at all this my passion. I love it is like not working. I'm in my dream job. I just need to get more. Jobs. Pay me well because there's a lot of times as photographer you have to do a lot of things event for free to get known. So it's a building process of relationships so i'm still in that process of building relationships. So that i can get more pay jobs but this is my dream job i love what i do. Well now i'm really back into it i used to do it a while that i got away from it but this meditation. I practice meditation i try to do it twice a day in the morning and at night before i go to sleep. I work with oprah and deepak chopra and anybody else who. Provides me with meditation. Can i use that too. , but. I can. Really control my templeton times i get set off i guess like any other human being. But i work at trying to keep a moderate intemperate. Temper and personality. Oh wow we argued with my daughter the other day about something i said and i did not mean to say it to hurt her but it obviously did. And we argued about. That what my intentions were my digital are never to hurt her and maybe what i said did. And that's what started the argument. Oh god i felt terrible because i never intended to hurt my daughter. And i never wanted her. And i felt bad that she had been hurt by what i have said. I had to help the guard my word to watch my thoughts. But i don't have much relationship with my with my brothers and sisters and mother and father my parents live far away. So it's just my two daughters here with me. And we have a pretty good relation. You know we try to work my my daughters and makeup artist i'm a photographer. So we work a lot together in the end. Sometimes i think we're up on each other to close. We need a little more space. Yeah when i say the wrong things. No is never easy to be a parent it's like working progress. Making the right decisions about things sometimes. The love the field look feeling of accomplishment. That you were able to raise the highest creation on this planet. To be a. Wonderful and. Productive human being. I'm not a strict is my parents where i give my kids a little more. Freedom to find out who they are. I'm not real religious like they do but i am very spiritual. So i brought them a different from me. On the religious. And. More i listen more to them i think than what my parents did was. You are to be seen and not heard when i was growing up and i let my kids voice be here. One night i had a bad night that changed my life and i don't want to go into details i feel bad about. Yeah i could have stayed home. I'm trying to think about in scituate. Maybe those handling of how i me and my husband divorce. I think i could handle that. Well we i think we really love each other a lot and we just was it was something that we had come to it. End. And the way we separated was kind of explosive. And i think both of us could have handled it better but i think i played a part in keeping a lot of drama going. Because i was hurt that we were breaking up. Kind of devastated because i wanted my child to be raised with her father. I think looking back now which is. You know hindsight is 20/20 vision. I could have handled things a little better. What can you do you do the best. Did you can at that time if you knew better you do better. The hardest decision i've ever had to. The hardest decision ever had to make. Was i was on my way to work as an enrollment counselor on the plane. Had a stroke. Was going to making a connection. And. To get on the other plant and then go to the hospital and a doctor was sitting behind me and he told me that i could not get on that plane. Because i might have another stroke that was a hard decision cuz i was in dallas texas all by myself i did not i mean i was in there with the employee but i would be left all by myself cuz my employees have to go on to montgomery alabama where we were headed. And i had to make a decision should i stay or should i go but my life was in the balance. I made the decision to stay and go to the. That was a hard one. Overwhelmed i mean here i am on my way to work. You know i flew. Two different state every week. And the help kids get get admitted into college and here i am on my way to work. I'm on the plane and i feel this. Weird feeling coming over the left side of my body. And i say my prayers when i go to sleep. And then when i wake up to get off the plane i can't remove my luggage from the overhead compartment which i did every week so i knew something was wrong. It was it was when you took your life. In the whole world in your hand and you don't know what's going to happen next. So is very disturbing very traumatic. And you know you don't know what happening to you is so the weirdest thing riding to. The hospital in a. Medical ambulance. That was a weird experience. But i'm here. You know i've survived is a doctor told me nobody survives it a stroke on a plane and i survive so. Universe wasn't finished with me yet. You know what's that sometimes i have a little problem with it. Sleeping a little bit sometimes. I get wired up. I get wired up just because i'm one of those real energetic persons and i have to finish what i set out to do it until i finished i can't go to sleep. So sometimes it's hard for me to go to sleep by the time i can lay down and just go but depends on what's going on in my head. Sluggish. Probably a little on edge. But i try to keep a puppy personality i'm really energetic person. So i try to but you know if you're tired your body is still talking to you. So. Lately i've been feeling really well except. I've been having some. Problems because i have a chance i had to stroke. I have nerve damage in my hand and in my face. And so i just it's i thought it's been over a year since i had two stroke but i thought by now it would have. Gotten a little better in that has it. But i'm so grateful to be alive. That. That is really minor compared to the bigger picture and i wasn't. Fortunately. My. I didn't lose my facial structure or you know my face is not screwed up like a lot of people are i still can use my hands i still can shoot with my camera that my left hand. Is diminished and use. But i can shoot with my right hand as a photographer so i can still keep doing my work. So you know i have to keep a good upbeat. Energy going on for me to keep. For me to be successful. No but i went through depression. From being knocked unconscious five times and i was a school teacher. Every ball there was that you could name soccer ball baseball basketball name that ball hit me in my head. And i've suffered from. Having a sleep apnea not being able to sleep. I'm being hit so many times and knocked unconscious in the head. No only i don't go to therapy because. I don't i don't have any medical right now. So i'm not able to get therapy they only offer that to people with medical. Hard to get it. I'm not work yet sucks i'm not working right now because i'm still trying to get my disability. So that i can. Get well cuz i'm going to be a fulfilled human being i want to be totally. And you know. The system it'll be almost two years before i go for a hearing. So that's kind of depressing to think after all the years i've been working since i was 16. And it's taking me it's been over a year or the year i had two stroke february 2012 and we are now in march of 2013 and i won't have a hearing until september 2013 just to tell me if i. Get the disability or not that's been very depressing for me because i'm wondering where i lived off my savings in the last year. And i. Got put my daughter through college you finished and now she's having to take care of me and she still looking for a job. My life is kind of up in the air right now. And some wonder what goes what comes next and so i'm just praying for guidance. I feel happy everyday everyday i wake up. And i can breathe and i can see and i can walk and i can talk and i can still shoot my photograph i'm happy it's just a good thing. To be in the present moment and to be alive. You know what i figured i'd look good of regrets you can't change the past all you can do is change right here and right now. So just move for it. What advice would i pay myself. Don't let anything get in your way. You know keep a good personality an energetic spirit. And just keep pushing. Energetic talkative. I won't take no for an answer follow-through reliable. Good-spirited. Giving loving. I'm most proud of that i. Have been able to find out my creative side i've been a visual artist i never took an art lesson before i taught art. I was. In my late twenties before i even discovered that i can draw and paint. I'm a doll collector. I'm at my creative side is what i'm most proud of because it's been able to help me. Being creative i can no matter what even when i was still very ill from having a stroke i could still go out. And just go take pictures. That was so soothing to my soul. That. I'm glad that i have a creative side of that i found it and have utilized it. That's is that it bubba. Why. Know that was kind of therapeutic. That really was therapeutic she was very nice to hear. \n",
      "Funny just move this i'm going to move this behind your arm if you do them. I agree. Okay. Yes. I'm pretty good. As far as my parents ethiopia. Yes. The beaches the warm weather. The diverse environment. Traffic. Well i'm currently in school i'm studying african studies. Always been interested in african studies actually have always wanted to help people and i figure that i can help them by. Trying to learn about it and going back to africa and making influence. Kind of in-between i have my shy moments but then when i'm around a group of people that angela i'm pretty alkaline. What i'm feeling. What are you doing. Interaksyon only right or i go to the beach and just sit there and play my guitar. How are you. Pretty good i don't really. Get angry or anything like that. I tend to keep it in. Or try to release it by writing. When was the last time you. Actually can't remember the last time i argue with someone. Okay. All the people i've hurt in the past. Can you tell me if. Well. I've. Fight cheated on people hurt their feelings intentionally. Done things i should have done that i regret now. Tell me about. That you wish you would. Well with my ex. I could have ended it better so we could be on better terms now. I probably should have argue so much as try to instigate so many things i probably should have just let it. Go with the flow and just see how it turned out. Hardest decision i've ever had to make was. Man i really don't know actually. Tell me about nevada. Having to see my dad go through surgery and see him suffer. Well he had a tumor that had to get removed so it's just hard seeing him have to be in the bed and just be in the hospital when he really don't want to be there cuz he's a really live person and he'd rather be running around and stuff like that but just saying i'm stuck in bed was just terrible. Tell me about your relationship. Me and my family are very close we don't i mean they've always been there for me and i appreciate it but we've never had that close collect connection. Especially since their foreign so they don't really understand where i'm trying to come from. Having been grown up out in america so it's pretty different when it comes to racial mean the cultural boundaries that we kind of step each other each other's feet on. But aside from that we have a decent relationship when we do speak to each other it does get kind of awkward but. Boca. I think they are out of control. I think that they're learning things that they shouldn't know at this age i think that they're doing things they shouldn't be doing and i don't feel like enough people are telling them that they shouldn't be doing it i feel like they're being applauded by the media they're being applauded by celebrities that they follow. And there's not enough being done about it and they're just getting lost. How easy is. Depends on the night. Some nights it's pretty hard some nights i fall asleep like a baby. What are you like when you do. Usually creative actually. When i can't sleep i'll just stay up and i'll write something or read a book and ideas will pop up. Stuff like that is usually a good thing when i can't sleep so nothing really bad cuz i'm having bad thoughts or anything like that. I'm lately between a mix of good and bad i have my happy moments where i'm energized and i'm live. Then some night some days where i'm just. You know just sitting there. This mellow thinking. Not like my life self. I don't know. His wife's been like that weighs have those ups in those downs but they kind of balance each other out. No. No. The last time i felt really happy was. Today. I'm just from the moment i woke up it was a beautiful sunny day. I. Went to see you some friends we had a good time went to school had some good grades on some papers wrote a good essay so pretty accomplished and. I feel like my days just. A good day. Tell your best friend. My best friend would describe me as. Odd. Most people would describe me as odd. I say a lot of odd things i do odd things i'm interested in things that most people aren't. Just like old literature revolutionary stuff. Stuff about changing the world. But. Through underground means. No i don't live a life of regret. I never let fear stop you from doing anything. I'm reading just hanging out with some friends. Driving around finding something to do just go on an adventure. What are some things you wish you could change it. I don't wish i could change anything about myself i just wish i could build myself into the person that i'm shirley supposed to be. This one time me and my best friend got into an argument. And she pointed out all the things i've done that i shouldn't have done all at one time how i've hurt people have hurt her. The ways i've done them that were brutal and it just made me feel bad once i reflected on it all. My parents. Tell me about. I mean although we don't see eye-to-eye the always bring me to this realization that i needed end of the day although i never listen to them or i don't choose to listen to him once it happens i learned from it and i'm like oh that's what my parents told me. So i learned to trust the more and i learn to understand that they are wiser than me and that they do know more than you. I'm not so much anymore i travel around la try to find you sides to see but as far as i don't travel outside. What do you enjoy about. I'm discovering new things. Discovering things you never knew were there. Or the limitless. Possibilities. I discovered i like i enjoy discovering you people new cultures. New things. Go against what's normal for us and for myself. A few days ago i just drove out to the middle of the desert. And i just sat there and i just enjoyed all that the desert has to offer and it was just enjoyable. How do you feel. I felt free away from all this. The city's needs buildings and it just felt nice to be out in the middle of nowhere at a completely random time. Feel good. Gyros proud of in your life. I'm most proud that. I've always been different. That. Despite how many people have told me that i'm really weird rum otter i think weird things i've always maintained my original. Mentality. Alright. \n",
      "Alright. Kraken. Thank you. Yes. Okay. Connecticut. Well i moved to san francisco 94 and then i moved to atlanta and 96. And then i moved out here to be an actor and i became a realtor instead. To be on a tv show actor. It's pretty hard to get discovered. Panda. You have to be lucky and you have to know the right people and you have to be talented. Not really know i don't travel that much i used to move. Every couple years to a different city. And then i've been here for a while so i don't travel. The weather. There's always something to do. And. Prettymuchit. The people here tend to be a little more rude. And. It's just always a fast pace. But when i moved here i was 25. So it was a lot more fun because when you're young and the city had a lot of fun. And then i got into the real estate and did really well for a while and then the market crashed and so now. I'm old and i'm not making any money so times are tough. No no i'm more of an extrovert. When i don't get what i want. And. Rude people. And. Just inconsiderate people. I'm pretty good at controlling my temper when i'm not like if i if i drink alcohol. It'll make my temper go worse. But when i don't drink i'm pretty good at controlling my temper. The last time i argued with somebody was. Somebody that owes me money. I live in west hollywood. I live alone by the dog. It's good i mean i don't like my neighbors i hate my neighbors but the ones upstairs just moved out so that's good news hopefully the ones that move in or not that noisy. And the ones below i just can't stand because they argue with me. Why because they took my hardwood floors they say that. I've been there for 10 years and they still argue about the noise of me walking on my hardwood floors. Yeah. What was the question. My mother has been a very positive influence she's always kept me on track. She lived with me for the last 10 years until she recently moved to rhode island to live with my brother. Very close to my mother. Not so close with my brother. We're close but we're not like close close. So i mean we love each other we just don't really. Understand each other all the time. Outgoing. Life of the party. Ambitious. And sometimes cutthroat. My most proud of. Being always able to get through the things i need to get through to get to where i want to be. I'm generous. I'm loyal. I'm friendly. I'm accommodating. And. That's about it. No. Yes. About. 4 years ago. Well i was beaten up and i had identity theft. And you know i was just afraid to go out so. I needed to get over that so after spending one year in in my home without leaving. That just depressed all the time i i said i have to get out and start talking to people and so i did. Thank you. I'm okay i'm panicking about the job situation. You know cuz my bills are pretty high. And i don't really have a steady income right now. So that's what's worrying me the most is my financial situation. Yeah i mean. Well basically it's like i just recently quit drinking altogether so i don't drink anymore. So i'm noticing yeah i mean it's good cuz the number one i don't have the money and number two i don't like the way i act when i drink. I'm so. So that's a positive thing but. Woody when i was drinking and help me just forget and numb myself. Now i have to feel through the feelings which is pretty good cuz i can talk my way through them. So i guess i'm evolving. Oh yeah long time ago and i've taken many medications here and there. They really some of them with numb me some of them would. Make me feel hyper. So i've recently decided in the last 6 months. Three to six months just to not take anything so i don't take anything i barely even take an aspirin. Get my body to a ticket my body to a normal state. Not really. Always worrying. A lot of worrying always worrying worrying worrying about everything old what happens if i get in a car accident what happens if. I can't pay my mortgage what happens if i. It just so many things i worry about and that's what was making me depressed. I do. At some point i've had. Some good therapist and i've had some bad therapist. I tend to like the ones that talk back to me. I got to give me some guidance as opposed to the ones that just listen. And then they just say okay your time's up so. And just prescribed me medication. So i think i'd be better with a psychiatrist psychologist as opposed to psychiatrist. Well i'm not going to therapy now but. The therapy that i had before. Was more like people trying to just come in and check in and give me medication. I have had other therapy where i was back and forth like okay well this is what i think about this and you think about this. And that kind of therapies better. I just. I wasn't getting the right therapist. Recently. So the root of my problem with the drinking. Cuz it's a depressant so. Stopping the drinking is definitely made me have a much clearer mind. Just a work through things myself you know. I can't really think of anything right now. It's been a long time i can't really think about. What time i felt really happy. Okay when i was a kid. I had a little dog. And this big dog came in and attacked and killed it. So then a little while later my father. Came and he says to my brother and me we were kids go to the car there's two packages in the car so go get them. So i was like yeah cuz i never listen to my parents. Sounds like a spoiled brat but finally said go to the car. What's up. Is it go to the car and get this out of the car. So i finally went when i open the door dog and a bag of dog food. So that's one of my memorable experience. Yeah cuz i'm an animal lover so. Just the way that i've treated people before when. I was hurting i was really mean or rude to people. But i felt like you know i was hurting i had to hurt everybody around me. So ever since i stopped drinking i don't do that anymore so. So i think the problem is is the drinking it's so now that i've let that go. For the wrong reasons you know i was doing it to not feel i wasn't doing it. To be sociable. Getting a career that is. Really stable. Like i you know like a doctor or a nurse or an attorney. Something that. You know orion advertising i should have gone into that. A sales position is it could be very well and very good or very bad so. You always have to be on it and sales you can make a ton of money and sells but when you make your money save your money don't go spend it on extravagant things. When i have a job when i when i'm able to work. When i'm helping other people. What other people around me are happy and laughing. When i can make people laugh set that puts me in a good mood. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome thank you. Okay. This is modeled after a real person or is it just like that. Security savitar. \n",
      "Therapy like this instead of fur. With a live you going to put all the nfl teams out of business. Arvest. I think it's good sometimes i think people. My talk to a stranger better or more open than to. If it's someone that might just come back up questions might judge you or. Our opinions of it's a virtual human being in might be a little less biased also. Kind of. Nothing's great idea. We could sit at home and do this instead of going into an office. Thank you very much. How do i know what does she going to say the end of session or okay. But also a minute. Oh i'm sorry. Not at all. Sorry about that. Pi m. I feel pretty good i'm wide awake i had any good breakfast in a nice cup of coffee. And a higher the easy day today so i am just going to chat with you. Then i'm going to the gym and run some errands so i plan on having a nice day today. I was born and raised in los angeles. And i'm one of the few locals from around here. And i went to school away. And. But i'm one of the few natives letter actually in los angeles. I like the weather. Having a vacation house on another state. I found to be too hot and humid in florida i love the weather here. I like the culture i like the diversity. I like the familiarity. I like that the beaches. Bass like that just an hour and a half away once and go to the desert. Palm springs palm desert. But also another hour and a half two hours we can go to arrowhead or big bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that. Rhonda. I think it's a great place to live. Well. Maybe some of the things i don't like that ale or say california in general say like the hi tax rate. Which. Estate tax rate is up to 13. Point something now. Which is going to chase business out of here also the regulations i'm a small business owner. So all the regulations are clearly affecting business somebody my peers above their business list. Texas arizona and nevada excetera some the other western states that are less regulated. And that's a big problem here and. California. It really does most people don't understand it but it's. Also wide. Yeah besides the high taxes you know there's a big immigration problem which being born and raised here most people don't. See that but it's a big tax on the social service system. And that's what makes our taxes. So high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of. So that's. You know the people don't seem to want to really deal with. Do that but it clearly affects businesses. Bs from all the other things that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state. I enjoy travel guide in the 66 countries. And. I don't travel as much as i used to. But i travel quite a bit. And i just learned a couple of languages and. Isurf. I'm sorry. I didn't really understand that your question. When you said like what i don't think you understood what i said. But i'll just go back and. I've been all through europe eastern europe. Asia. South america. North africa. And i enjoy that. And. Enjoy the warm climates now especially where you can go and relax where is warm waters surf. Is the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up. I also like to exercise surf and do yoga. And workout. Panda. I try to eat healthy and. That's a big part of my life. What are my favorite trips of all time where they used to when i was younger see how many countries i can do in a relatively short period of time saying as three or four weeks span. But about 10 years ago. We actually went to paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city even though i've been there about 10 times. We got to know the city really well which was great really live like a local. And rent a small flat. And did our own shopping but really. Have you been there so many times it really never stayed for more than 3 or 4 days. It's fun to stay there for about you know almost a month. And i really get to learn the city. And it was fun. Even though i grew up in a lie i go taking french. Which there wasn't a big spanish speaking population when i when i was younger. My mother insisted that all of us kids take french. Give me a spanish would have been a lot more valuable that i took french. All three of us. Elementary junior high and. High school. That was nice to practice my french. I don't remember a whole lot even though i start speaking french. With the french. You know my accent isn't the greatest effort couple of sentences they start talking english to me. That was out. I have a few different degrees. So. I was in naval science major is an undergraduate. And. That was fun. Ass of a master's degree in economics. Kind of degree in crisis management. So. Interesting. And. Just something that i wanted to do where i went to college i went to the naval academy i'm up there to play sports. And i found it real interesting being from southern california going to school in maryland. That really want to be a doctor but. We start going to school. For a little bit you change your mind. Excetera so. I'm actually in the wholesale business. Or wholesale distributors. A furniture products. And it was a family business but i went to work their number beers ago. One of my grandfather recently father passed away so i was going to run up. 80 roll family business and its. Pretty interesting i like it having grown up around it. But different other jobs at in the past. Actually probably my dream job has funds cooking and staying at home. I would probably like to stay home and raise kids besides you have one daughter. And. You didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as i would have liked. But. I think i would be a better than say a lot of women i know that want to work i actually like cooking and hanging out around the house and taking care of kids. You know that i like doing it always on a part-time basis but it seems like boy that would be fun to stay home and not. Did that happen pretty much worked for most of my life. Probably never happen but it sounds something that to me it would be fun. I think i am generally more reserved and shy with strangers. But when i get to know someone or feel comfortable. I think i'm more of an extrovert. More strangers might think i'm more introverted. But i think when i feel comfortable with certain people and i don't know what it is i can meet a stranger and be totally. Confident or people i might have known for years either from a personal or business situation. And be more. Introverted. I mean that. i just go with the dynamics but. I think my outward manifestations to be a little more shy generally andrazajtis like these the term reserved. Oh wow that's a great idea i used to have that on. One of my guys several computers at home. And i bet you sweetheart of my screensavers as well i usually tend what what i need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events and exercise while you're be yoga. We're going for a long walk. We're going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach. Yeah baby going surfing of the weather is warm i don't start from cold weather anymore cuz it makes. Because you like a brain freeze not surfer enough over 30 years. I had. It on. I should find exercise helps miralax the best. Or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the tv i find relaxing. I like that screensaver i used to have that on one of my screen savers at home. Amazon. That was it but. That's one of the things that took me a number of years to master that were my relaxation skills i probably didn't have them the best of my 23 over the years. I think i've gotten better. I think that's a key thing and i think as we mature. As we learned how to do that i wish i'd learned how to do that. Be a little more. Hadn't had those skills earlier. I'm pretty good i think i'm a lot better as well as that as i've aged. You know i. I'm more likely to. Think before i speak now. Whereas a 20 years ago is more likely act before i thought. Salman said more things that i. What about 10 situation where there be personal are. A work situation. But i've never had a violent temper but i would have a temper where fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and really reflecting on it. A lot better at that now that i was saying my. Teens are twenties. I think a lot of that comes out. Keyboard there is maturity. Oh wow. I really had an argument with anybody in somali whatever considerate traditional. Argument. Probably. My ex-wife and number of years ago. we had an argument basically just over my daughter. It wasn't anything wrong but it was heated just basically one of the reasons we weren't married our values are so different just our ideas of parenting. And just. Outlook on life was so different nothing that cost. Oster butt heads but it's just i know if i call an argument. But it was more of just staying one of those let's agree to disagree. Butt heads some. I felt like i was talking to a wall. And i actually felt more mad at myself that i should have. Learned earlier in life with boys it before you get married to someone that folder with them that's the kind of discussions that people should. Usually have but you're not really thinking about that because. Sometimes our younger worth. Looking at boy how does that i look great on paper to her and she look great on paper to me. You know. I'm pretty easy-going i have. Different. Ideas on raising children have she did. And it was more. Not that she was wrong. And i was right not that i was right she was wrong. It's just how we raise our different views and we never really. Discuss those things but it was really just fundamental. Reason why we butted heads weren't really a good match. Whereas other things look good. Yeah i'll pay for the both of us. Recently my father passed away recently. Thank you. And. Really because in our religion your planner funeral very quickly you know typical. a couple of days. And i really only invite very very close friends and family members. How does morales sort of in charge of it my dad is remarried but his widow is sort of. Not really up to it so i took care of it and i wish i invited a. I kept it very private and really just told people after the fact. That he knew that would have liked to have come. To the service and been known. About it so i really know lee invited pics just before the time pressure really just a handful of people but. Now it's times past i wish i invited. More. His friends instead of just two or three close friends. Yeah 10 or 20 quite citizen people he knew from. Business are over the years and i really just. And even distant family members i really just told after the fact i really didn't invite him this. I was under a time pressure but. I could have easily have done it via email or toward to call everybody personally but. I wish that something's people of. Express little. They're upset with me one my other family members through it all back at me oh you didn't tell me till after the fact that. Someone said i passed so they all through the media's i was more or less. Doing it's i wish i did that differently but i did the best i could at the time so i'm not really. Mad at myself that's something i probably should have been more prepared for us episode was something that was coming was inevitable so. Both my parents are recently. Deceased in the last couple of years. And at a brother that i've three are brothers one who passed away. In december. And. We're not super close like i always like i look at other families we were just never liked that norman rockwell painting. Because we're all so different. And i. I have a closer relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family. Not that it's strange but i wish it was more like boy one of those families i got together every sunday and had dinner and all that. We just. Never did that because we're all. Also i. I different. That's how it is but. You know strangers most of us how do you spell scrape. But i think every family has their own sort of. No but that probably could have had it before from. Some other events in my life i just wasn't sure i've had been to some therapy in the past just from. You know i was in the military. And i was never really sure if that that's exactly what it was. But i think i function. Pretty well but i just wasn't sure that i have been this therapy and counseling over the years. I didn't enlist as an officer. Which one of the service academies. 17 that started after high school. Bad witch was service academy. So it's more prestige just isn't enlisting it's the hardware i went to sell her to school in america to get into. I was but same age as everybody else and went there. We did. 1983. Just basically wasn't anything intense as we're just around we were just. We weren't allowed to carry ammunition we were just our positions were just shells. Leprechaun. And poison gas was sprayed on us. Sound. That was a. I was at wasn't anything too. To attend suppose you know. Biggest fit the service i was in the training is way more intense in any actual combat situation. That's because they trained you well like you practice harder than you play maranatha. Play football practice harder than you. Dashie playing the game the same with. You know janet combat. Unit. I may be more patriotic having grown up. In california. Where people were from all over the country. And i got to meet was mostly my friends who grew up in the affluent los angeles like i did. Never really went out and met a lot of american some people from different backgrounds and a. Ended up becoming. Just more patriotic a deeper sense of pride in the country. What is really don't grow but that in southern california where someone in texas or kentucky or tennessee year. Georgia north dakota south dakota montana. It was up with that kind of a. Pride so i thought it was getting any. Unlike somebody my friends that. They don't know any there's any life between malibu and manhattan. I went to graduate limestone the reserves. But i went to graduate school. Anna got to graduate degrees. And i would work in private enterprise. Didn't care for it. Yeah they join the fire department as a firefighter and paramedic. For number of years. Again after i got divorced it was hard to do the custody situation with my daughter so i went to work in the family business that's pretty much my career. Donut shop. At first it was difficult because i just had such a bearing on my but from the way i walked i talked. And i guess i was an officer. You're very regimented on the way you dressed in your. Private time is harder to be wild. Feel to come back to los angeles. Ps i was just. Sowell. So different i think i handled better than most i have a stronger personality. It's a great experience. It all depends if i exercise regularly and i don't eat too late. And things are going well in my life by generally sleep pretty well. Even though i might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night now. But generally sleep. I still asleep pretty well. I feel pretty good lately. Yeah i didn't like anybody else more periods of blowing your life but. But lost you must have felt great pretty much. No not really. I seem like i seem a little happier more content lately. I thought maybe in the past said you have a family history of it. And. You know. It wasn't. Anything real to debilitating. And i wasn't able to really function. Am i embarrassed concerned with insight counseling. I did i was really against in the past. And until after i went and then i wish i went more safe during my. My marriage or the course of my life now i think it's very useful however in the past. I was one of those i grew up hearing that it was just. Ridiculous. It was a waste of money excetera but i think it's a useful tool that you're open to it. Just some questions i want to just an honest opinion outside of friends or. Strangers from a professional. You know about. Life relationships. And sometimes it's good talking things out with us. A professional. Even though i wouldn't see somebody like you in real life i prefer someone who's older than i am. A little more life experience and some of his maybe younger. So but i think it's a useful tool and. I really did a 180° switch on that. I don't know now i'm started taking a break from it but i'm not against it if i have some issues i want to bounce off. I give someone that i can go to. I think it's nice. You know they really. If you got to someone who's good and again i've been there a few different people at start of therapist shopped. They really don't tell you what to think which i think is great you know that's always in the passages help you talk through your. Your thoughts. And your feelings i'll let you decide yourself but bring a little clarity. To the situation that's why i like. Talking to someone else a lot more life experience. And i generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman. Doc mcstuffins h1 man. So but it's. I think it's a useful tool i got some good ideas and. Was able to place bouncing some things off totally some of his unbiased is not in your day-to-day life. Instead of talking to her a romantic partner or close friend in w. But sometimes bouncing people off a stranger is good. All this morning. I know this is weird but i'm clearly someone and i'd say this is a joke to my friends in. Family and associates at clearly having to having an easy day today anyway. nice weather. Bunch of errands to run. And i clearly have seasonal affective disorder but i woke up so happy today when i know it's going to be 80 degrees out. And when the weather is nice i'm generally a lot more happier than when the huntress dark and blue and rainy and called. Where i was i know that time so. Time is what i woke up really happy today the same as going to be nice day. I look forward to feeling the sun. Most of my friends i'm sort of a renaissance man i know a little bit about a lot of subjects i'm too smart for my own good. Don diamont. I know a lot. Got a lot of problems. Things are pretty rational. Very resourceful. People always call me when they have issues. I'll talk them through it or and resource won't tell them where to go. Whether it's where to buy a new computer or buying your car or. You know i'm great with medical diagnosis. And. People say i'm a lot of fun. You can't be with. Don don. Also have i don't have a lot of gray areas people either really like me or don't like me. Me thinks we're pretty much black and white. I am what i am. I don't bs. Yeah. I'm the opposite of a politician. So i don't tell people what they want to hear to be rude. rude anybody but. Call things like sam. So that's pretty much. No not really to do everything tactfully. I like to think i do. Ice bobby spent more time with my parents before they passed but it's busy. I probably wish i was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was young there. But just one of the three typical. Really to think things through a little bit more be a little less impulsive. Pretended to be more impulsive when i was younger than i am now. I think that's that's it. And it would look at things in the long-term instead of looking. The things in the short-term. Can we make decisions or choices. I'm proud of my daughter she's. Nice young lady i am. Proud of my public service i've never done a job really for money of my. Military service and fire service. You're very few people like me who did it. A horse. The background and education that i did. I like public service. And. Some proud of that. I'm tired of all the certificates i have hanging on my walls at home in degrees. Sort of like. Trophies. Improvident being able to stay really good physical shape over the years and. Knock would maintain good health. It was nice meeting you. Bye-bye thank you. How was i. Ray bans like this when you said. Oh yeah. \n",

No. I haven't planned on. 7 finalize any travel plans. Listen to music. Yeah. Well i tend to excel things. How to do a thumb. Spending time alone versus. Things that have to do with.

Some tasks. I don't go to a therapist. Reasonably smart and quit inquisitive and curious. I guess two classes. Somewhat. Patience and curiosity. I went on a walk at night. A day ago. No. Can you repeat that. Can you rephrase that. Hinder lucky very lucky. Got everything in front of them. Yeah. Most proud of. Maybe i could do makeup cheeseman's. I guess just the time to spend.

I studied music industry. Yes i work in the music industry. Has a passion of mine and i. Got a new school and went with it. How hard is what. I don't really have a dream job i don't know if that exist. Actually it's probably changing all the time. Depends on the situation. Sometimes i'm shy and sometimes i'm outgoing. Well i can't see your shoes. But i like to travel yes. Meeting new people seeing new things. Exploring the landscape. I went to alaska. On a fishing trip. On that trip. Catching an octopus. I was deep sea fishing and. For halibut. And rather than catching a halibut. I learned in a octopus. Play golf i swim. Iread. I'm pretty calm. Probably couple days ago but it was. And it was about. A musical project that was involved in. I felt heated. I'm not quite sure. I'm not quite sure. I have to think about that for a while. I'm not really sure. I had a bad performance one time. And i wish people who i knew didn't see it. Because we weren't well-rehearsed and. I was embarrassed afterwards. I have a brother and parents who are divorced. I'm pretty close i see them. Regularly. Talk openly about. Most subjects. My brother. What do you want to know. About my brother. I'm not really sure. Most of the time it's pretty easy. I drink more coffee to compensate. Fine. No. What is ptsd stand for. No i haven't. I'm happy all the time. Ambitious a go-getter. Feisty. I'm not quite sure. I can't recall right now. I went to a concert. Salt live music. Drink good beer. Yeah. I'm a good listener. Compassionate. And. I'm alert. Ever. In regards to what. No i don't i don't i normally don't regret things. Because there's too much else to live for to think about the past. Do you. Okay. What was that question. To read more and watch tv. Watch the computer screen less. Because that makes you. Have attention deficit disorder. And you focus less on things that are in front of you in real life. I know. Exercise i sleep in late. I. Go. Golfing from time to time. I go to concerts i go to bars hang out with friends at the beach it depends. What are my most proud of. I'm healthy and i understand. The world around me and i'm. Passionate about. Things that i'm doing and i have goals that i've set. That i'm working towards. Yeah. What was your name. That's right. Goodbye. Okay. \n",
      "Okay. Yes. Feeling well. Los angeles the greater los angeles area. People. Diversity. And. Various entertainment and activities. Fickle weather. Traffic. And letter. I have travel domestically not internationally. Seen other places and how people live in the culture. The last ship that i went to a san diego. Butt out. From childhood or as an adult. Family vacations to baja in rosarito beach. Yeah the reason why that memory comes to mind because. This weekend is easter and we usually will go. Down to east easter spring break. 2 rosarita baja. I might have a bachelor's in communication studies. Because of the open. Feel. Just doesn't deal with them. Communication interactively but performing arts. Telecommunications. Business entrepreneurship so. No i'm not at maxine unemployed. I think 20 my business that's my dream my dream job to have my own company. I would like to open something like the telecommunications area. As a business. Something do online online services. I like to make things with my hands. So my next venture with. Would be to create all-natural soy candles. Something in that area. A mixture. Mixture of shy and outgoing because i have to observe people in crowds. And that's how usually make a determination of phi. Remain reserved remain open. What are you doing. I listen to like a meditation tape or i take a walk. Or go get a massage. Fair. Omad. Probably yesterday or this morning. Usually the argument is about. Me making myself clear. Army repeating myself twice. No usually gets the other person in trouble. I redeemed a service from a mechanic who fix my transmission. And i had a warranty. And i wrote to the department of consumer affairs. And the guy offered me a portion of. The settlement agreement. And i decided to take him to small claims court. To get a bigger amount. And i wish i would have have. Taking the offer that he gave me. At the midst of. Dealing with a third party which was. The department of consumer affairs. And because of that i took him to small claims court and i end up losing. The whole settlement and only been offered a very small portion. So i wish i would have. Taking the higher road to taking the lower road. Intend to feel guilty about too many things. Hardest decision. I don't know financially emotionally. Emotionally letting go of past relationship. The hardest thing to. How to say the hardest thing but it was a difficult thing. Yes it was relationship of 7 years. But that person is already moved on. So. They want me to be in their life. In hopes that. If something goes wrong with my current relationship. We'll always have something to fall back on. Yeah it is hard. An event. So that i can trace for my memory. I don't know there's a lot of events. That i just automatically erase from my memory but whatever comes to mind right. Probably the death of a relative. I'm alone and misinformed. Because i didn't know that they were that sick. And i didn't know that they were their days were numbered. And i could have had more opportunity to. Spend time with them. Make. Better a better connection in the last days. It's fair to midland. My immediate i'm very close but distant not very close. My mother. Yes she's encouraged me to. Continue my education. To always fall back on my. Hobbies hopes goals and dreams. He always encourages me to. Always stay loose and. Out there looking for a better opportunity. And she encourages me to. Not be afraid to. Explore other ventures. Easy. I've been feeling well. Yes a little stressed but i'm trying to manage that. I leave the stressful environment. In the past. About 3 years ago. Because i was having issues in my learning environment. And down. I was feeling emotionally attached. Yeah i was having an issue with a professor who. Was just very. How do you have a very different personality. And. He almost ran me down the crosswalk as school. I felt. I felt like i was in a dishonest environment. I felt. Like i wanted to get you know switch his class and get into another class. But i had no choice but to stay in there and deal with his meanness for the whole semester. I think through finding ptsd they were trying to link depression. No. Financially. I'm not capable. And i haven't found a counselor who's willing and committed. To working with me and helping me with my issues. I find a lot of cancers they listen to me. And they laugh at me and they tell me. The opposite of what. What i'm telling them. Last time i felt really happy. I really don't know. That's a good question. Just just do what i want i just relax. I just relaxed and. You know i don't know. I don't have any best friends. My best qualities that i'm. Hard-working i'm reliable. I'm an excellent friend. I'm energetic. And i'm going to go get her. Things that i wish i could change about myself. Probably be less sensitive. Don't take things so personally. And. Learn how to help myself before helping others. Not have any regrets in my life. If i could do things differently 10 years ago. I probably would have. Focus and study more. And less. Being out of the house in. Hanging with friends. Baguette have a college education. And i'm self-sufficient. And. I can pay my bills by myself. And. I'm alive.

Because i'm just always thought. That the conveying of. Emotions are feelings. Be like better understood with a human interaction as opposed to a non-human entity such as yourself. Yeah. I think you see what i mean i'm from. Born and raised in los angeles venice area marvista specifically. That's where i'm from. Well. A lot more that i don't like but what i do like is. That public transportation is coming up. That the idea of. Sir and you know medical drugs like marijuana is. A prevalent you know topic very thought upon and i feel. That los angeles is deep culture is why i stay here and pursue my art because. Is a lot too. There's a lot to gain from the different communities if you understand. Yeah. Well. The. The human. Mentality here is. Is very is very hectic very chaotic. You know a lot due to. The vehicle the car the freeway. And this idea that were on. A grind you know this. Yeah it's it's very it's very hectic. Atmosphere humid atmosphere that. Is not very conducive for a supporting loving community. Help each other out kind of thing. Yeah. Well i can't see your shoes. But i love to travel i do love hiking i do love. Surf & swim in biking riding taking rides i do love to travel you. From my travels it's not like. Well i do enjoy a lot of things about travel but. It's more like what do i. It's it's just more like i enjoy not being. I trapped in the city with all these made up ties and restraints enjoy. Traveling because. I get to see the world as it really is instead of this photo image. You know a man-made image that it is here. I love traveling because i get to get out of this and see the world as it is. Thanks. Would you. Okay. Well. Kind of recently last year went to. Los banos central california area. And although it wasn't that far from la it was. Completely different energy there is no phones. There's no wi-fi. There was some. Their sanity there was a relative sanity. In the sense that. People want deluded and getting all of this input from digital media and outer influence people registrar real and hiking and showing i was working at a hot spring resort. And i just. Got to breathe and hike. And farm and do a lot of carpentry. Not. Hard you do you don't even think about. Difficulty when you're doing things you. Truly love and enjoy so it wasn't. I guess. Kind of what i described about the city i just wanted to. Get out of here and. Kind of. Just get out of here really and just experience the real. The real deal. I'm well. Currently i'm studying. Currently i'm studying. Physical therapy. I'm about to become licensed massage therapist. But before that yeah it kind of cool but before that i was going to. I'm for music composition so i was just writing scores for. Films animations dance productions theater productions. Stuff like that. School is fun trippie. Very trippy videos cool but i had to leave that because. Tuition hikes. Up to you now going up to like $50,000 a year for like a four-year bfa. Is not not the deal not trying to. Trap myself with these chains of federal loans. So yeah. Hey that's not a good word sucks. Dream. Job. My dream job would be. Anyting. That i can do to. Alleviate these metropolitan. Like cities from. The nightmare that they've been put in my dream is to alleviate the nightmare my dream is to. Insight dream back within. The modern human worlds. And. Within a physical therapy and artistic expression. I've got some. Great ideas. I guess my ago and i just like just like experiencing things so i'm going. What i'm feeling. I thought those really funny what i do to relax. Can i breathe it out. Chill maybe make it. Smoothie your 70 i'm going to go bike riding. Right. Pretty good i guess i haven't. Detailed in a long time. What wasn't. Arguing i don't i don't really argue much i just. Like to save my. Opinion. And have it be understood and i like the person i'm conversing with to stay there. Opinion and have it understood so. The last time that happened was. I guess yesterday chilling in downtown with a friend from new york and we're talking about writing and basically we were not arguing but talking about. Opinions in that sometimes. Things are not ready to be written. Yeah so yesterday. Kelty. Stuff i haven't had that feeling in a long time. Kilz what about you what's something you feel guilty about. Okay. I don't really. I wish i could erase anyting. From my memory cuz then that would just. Be. Like. I would feel something was lacking from my current present life if. Something just got erased in a butterfly effect kind of. Like yeah. Maybe the time. I'm sure going to school i was taking the year off and i was just. Kind of hanging around. But we had an apartment together with another friend. And it didn't turn out. You know not all. Nothing turns out as a. Not to be and that's kind of a beautiful thing about it but. This one turned out a little. Little different actually quite different than i thought it would be in. I thought it was funny but yet ended up on me leaving before the lease ended. And dad actually ended up. Yeah with the separating. But that's something i wish. Maybe i handled a little more thoughtfully. Hardest decision. Maybe maybe not hard dissed by a hard decision to make was leaving. Cool. Dropping maya. Continuation of achieving a bfa. Yeah that could have been the hardest. Chester i don't. I mean of course money money is the model money is biggest shoe. Tuition hikes going around the whole nation. Not a fan of that not a fan of not a fan of support that. Yeah that's probably one of the biggest reasons why i just don't support. These crazy. Tuition axolotl ramp and. Another reason why i. Decided to leave at to make a hard decision to decide to leave was. Also because art institute you know that's it. The funny idea and itself already and basically i was a musician. Being taught by a musician. 2. Make music. And same with you know all that all the dancers are the theater students you know getting tot dance. To a dancer from a dancer how to. Dance you know. And it's just. Yeah it's just not. Quiet. As artistic as. I thought. Art would be. Art comes from somewhere at summersweet and deepen purple and not not from out there and i'm so yeah. If i. If i. It's kind of easy i mean it depends you know if i. Remember to make some chamomile tea or 5. Remember to breathe and go through my. Montresor. Remember to do my pre like dream therapy work. Then i can get into a real nice. But if i just get diluted with all my thought then it takes a long time until i. Remember to breathe. Yeah. I'm you're basically just what i said just breathing or you know if i'm. Hanging out with friends coming home late and if i get the lucky chance to be medicated from you know a nice. And ice indica then it really does you know it indica does put me down pretty nice. Pretty drowsy so a lot of things breathing you know in a medical herbs. Chamomile cannabis and. Just a going relieving myself of bad bad juju. I guess not if i can't think of something now. I've been feeling. Kind of like. Like this. Anna just cruising. Anna anna gray line but it's a nice grey it's really nice hue. Some people wouldn't like this but i really like that and it's. It's stable. That sits comfortable now. No. No i haven't. Not. Buy a certified medical professional now but. Now i haven't. Yeah man i just think. Like the whole. You know like you said ptsd depression and. You know other in a mental instabilities i think. Everybody. Is depressed i think everybody is overjoyed i think everybody's angry and everybody shy everybody's social all at the same time you know it's just different days different univariance different floats different boats you know different. Waves different swells so yeah i think. I'm depressed i think i'm really happy i think i'm. Really angry i think i'm. Really friendly and all that but just on different variates. Different floats. Really happy. I am going to feel really happy a lot. And i feel really sad a lot but really happy. Maybe this morning when i was just biking over here. Enjoying the sun enjoying the breeze. Biking. Yeah it is. Well a lot of best friends and they prescribed me off i'm pretty differently but underlying that same idea. It maybe i'm just maybe. And that she'll just kind of aquarius. I guess. Well i'm 21 so 20 years ago. I would have told myself to keep being a baby. Stay young. And don't lose sight you know don't stop listening. Keep letting things happen don't make them happen b. Be a beautiful baby that's what i would have told myself. Yeah. Beautiful baby. Lancaster recently what has been shown to me through me by me. Is my ability to work. With others and amanda speaking an artistic standpoint i've been a. Collaborating a lot. With. Artists working on a lot of different. I'm mediums mixed-media projects and. I'm really. Comfortable with it and with other people's and melting or ideas together. Yeah. That's a weird question like. Like that's trying to make me single out. In a one moment that i. Today reflect upon and think about like it's some past glory that i'm not capable for feeling today so. I think the proudest moment of my life is right now. Chilling. Hanging with you. Yeah.

      "Okay. I'm not a therapist. Yes. I'm alright. Stop alarm. Weather. The women. Opportunities. Started. Racism. Police brutality. Injustice. You travel a lot. No. Not much of a. Exploring type person. Psychology. It was one of the classes i excelled in the most. So i decided to. Change it for business in psychology. Yeah. Yes. No. Tom own record label. Mom. Is my really hard but you know. Take it one day at a time just i guess you know. Stay focused. Lil bit of both. I tend to be shy and. Situations i'm not comfortable with our new to. And i'm outgoing and places are more comfortable with. What are you doing. Turn the lights down low and listen to soft music. I'm getting better over the years. I think i'm. Pretty decent now compared to how i used to be. Yes ma'am. Due to the lack of i guess you can say controlling my emotions. I have gun carcerated sent to prison. I'm not sure. I don't really have a. The recollection of my hardest decision ever made in my life. Probably few days ago. With the girl i was talking to and i was arguing about. A lack of communication. And attentiveness. Yeah. I frustrated. Because. You know how you be put in a certain amount of effort and you expect. You know. The same effort. By the person when you're in a relationship. In the same time when you when you have expectations sometimes you kind of set yourself up for failure so. You know i guess i'm just learning. A lot of situations overhead differently. Probably. The most recent was. I got into a physical altercation. With an inmate. When i was incarcerated. And that. Maybe that's what sent me to prison in and i had to do a lot more time. And. If i handled it differently. I probably would never want the president and i probably would have been home a lot sooner. Then originally. Apnea. Her several events i wish i could erase my memory. Probably. My first girlfriend. She did something really extreme. It wasn't necessary my eyes. And it and it could have cost me my life. I think that that that's a recurring thought today i wish i could. Completely erase memory. Along with the good memories as well. A few youtube fights. I guess you can say shootouts. Getting job getting robbed. You know those things i think those inhibit me. I guessed it explorer. Certain areas of life that i'm not comfortable with so those are the few things that. It when i so i can erase it completely. Yeah. Hurt people i didn't need to be hurt. Emotionally especially. Few women in my life are my past. Probably put my mother through certain things i shouldn't have to go through. Along with my close friends and family as well. Tell me about your relationship with. Used to be rocky. Going up but as i got older mature. And discerning spirits that i've been through kind of brought me closer to my family so now it's it is pretty decent this is pretty decent. I would say my mother. Yeah mother. Oh she she she had her share of experiences. Negative and positive. My my her struggle she been through. She she she has experienced difficult economic hardships growing up. But that didn't stop her for raising the sun at a young age. Finishing school getting her masters. I'm just just overall being a good person and she also about her mental health issues as well. And. Probably not the best of family. She could have mermaids with her so she's kind of like a inspiration to to me and other people as well so. How's your mother. It's not easy. So it's not easy.

Certain situations better yeah. Well instead of just always reacting on a motion no matter what kind of emotion it is. I step back in and then assess situation. And i'll to see what's what's the best way to to react. Towards situation. And by doing that. It has made me more mature. Emotional immature. And just. Has positive outcome. I was lying next to a beautiful woman. Who cared about me and the feeling was mutual so that was probably the most. Happy. Oh my goodness. Spontaneous. Outgoing. Sometimes a little crazy. Fun. That's about it. What are some things you wish. Nothing. Like i said earlier just. You know hurting. The few women that were my life my past and. My friends are family that's about it. Oh s***.

Singing i'm a singer so unforgettable. So that's where i like to do. No. No. No. Haha that's the hard part i don't. I don't know maybe it's because when i was. The kid my brothers. Beat me up and.

Did you want me to. I'm okay i mean i'm pretty easy-going. For the most part i don't really have a temper per se. Things frustrate me more than they anger me. Oh that's easy with my mother she's like. I guess the argument stem from me wanting to. Socialize. I married with children so i should stay at home. Ninety-nine percent of the time. And i wanted to go out and socialize with ex co-workers and she. Basically. Got to put me down for it is if i don't spend enough time with my children. It does. And i love my mom i hate even having the thoughts of being frustrated with her. Because i was sick gosh i don't get mad at her that something happens to her the next day. But. She gets caught in truth. Oh i know. After the semester ended when i noted that. And i did well in school cuz i have been helping a long time since i went to school so. When i received my grades you know a dabby as i go out okay i can do this and it made me happy. And i was about. A few weeks ago i guess. Thank you.

Like she wants to re-raise me or something like she doesn't understand that i'm an adult i'm going to make my own decisions now and. Pretty much have to let me do what i need to do. A lot of. Heavy breathing when i get a little frustrated whatever i'll just go take a walk. You know or i'm just try not to think about it. Thank you. Yes. Yes. The navy. I was 19. Yeah.

      "Okay. Yes. I'm doing good. I'm originally from southern california. I like the downtown theater district i like the beaches i like the variety of stuff that you can do in one day. Well sometimes i don't like the traffic. I don't think there's really too much i don't like about l.a. i really do like it later though. No i haven't really travel. In about. 5 years. Oh i just haven't been able to travel. I just haven't travel. I like going to new places and seeing things i haven't seen before and if i can like visiting um. Places like landmarks. Well the last one i did was san francisco that wasn't so far. But i got to stay in downtown san francisco i got to go shopping. And i got to get on him the streetcar so that was cool. Well i still study i'm studying psychology. Well. I decided to go back to school just pretty quickly so i went to junior college. And then when he got close to graduate i knew i want to transfer so. I taking a couple psychology courses not decided i liked it so i just decide to make that my major. And. I thought i didn't have a lot of math but it had. Enough math. Well now that i'm almost done. I don't know if i'm going to continue in that area. Well would i wanted initially was to get into sports psychology but i'm not. Quite sure that's what i want either. Well. I have to be shy initially but once you get to know me i'm outgoing. I think i either go to sleep eat something really really good or watch something on netflix. What's a good movie i like for movies a lot so a lot of. Right now i'm into martial arts movie with subtitle so. I think i'm pretty good. You know i know. They're not really log arguments i don't know if there were arguments i know i argue with my boyfriend and i don't know why. And he got soft pretty quickly so i don't know if it was really that important. We all walk out without say okay. I can't think of one right now. I think. The hardest decision i probably had to make. Who is moving from. Go back to california from oregon. But i was really young so i was. 19/20 and i was really by myself so that was pretty hard cuz i obviously had to support myself. Because it was a really really boring in oregon so am i really like the activity here in la. You know i don't really feel guilty about many things. Well i don't talk to them that much my dad my stepmom live in oregon so i. Probably talk. Two on the phone at least once or twice a month. And then when i come out here i want to say at least once a year sometimes it can be twice you know occasionally more but not too often and i see them. That's about it but i'm pretty much the only one out here my brother is also up there as well. Yeah. What have lots of positive influences i think i'm. Just regular people are coming across you know maybe someone off work with maybe. My uncle he's a really good positive influence he knows quite a bit has lots of good advice. About life. You know i don't really think i've had anything that bad happened to me where i just don't. What bothers me so much i have to not think about it. Well i can't say pretty easy cuz i work schedule and then i go to school but. I want to go to sleep i sleep really well those long as i have enough you know hours. Really really happy and good. Nope. No. Always happy. Happy anytime i talk to my boyfriend or if i go out and do something i'm just happy i got off work i'm happy cuz i'm done for the day i'm just really happy. I'm on spring break i'm really happy right now so. Oh i haven't liked any really extremely fun activities unless you consider going out to eat. But the last activity. That i had a lot of fun doing was ice skating in december that in downtown la. No i don't really have to negretes i mean whatever happens happens and he knows mental play out that way. Well. I guess i would say don't worry too much about the small things. Even though they seem really big really they really are insignificant and. You won't think about it 6 months from now. I think my. Best qualities are i'm a happy person i'm a fun person i'm pretty easy to get along with i think most people like me. And i'm just a cool person. Well i wish i could study more i wish i would study more. I wish that i will exercise more. I wish that. I think that's it right there. I don't think i want to talk about that. I don't know i guess i'm just taking care of myself before myself not having to go back home i guess that's about the best accomplishment there is. Thank you. Okay was that you in the other end.

In the screenwriting program. Took a long time it was difficult. Just the. Getting used to and managing this stress of everyday living. Variety of right here like that. Dallas traffic. Internationally no. Just haven't had. Reason to i guess. I have a bs in math and physics. I went to school later in life. And i wanted to actually. You know something. So it was very difficult. Very difficult. I did it. Why. Fascinated me i didn't want to be intimidated by it. Oh yeah. To be employed writer. Dreamly difficult. Extremely difficult writing. Any type of.

Why humpback so he didn't like that. He pulled up alongside me i had have no idea what his problem was. And we had a few words. I mean i have no idea what i was doing wrong just waiting for the light. Guilty that's a strong word. Don't know if i feel guilty as i feel remorseful about actions or words.

Whatever reason and just out of the blue hit you in my call. Why they say that what i do that. Situation. You you. Got a blank. For me that question has a negative connotation. So something that's possibly negative in my recent past. What would have done differently. I don't. I'm pretty in control. Of my emotions. And taking the temperature of the moment and responding knowing when to respond when an annoying not to respond. So nothing really springs to mind that i wish i'd done differently recently in my past past yes but not recently. Oh. Swallowing my pride. Pudding. My tail between my legs. And saying i was wrong to friends. I contacted him again and then we're fast friends again. Now this is again this is past past. So. Not recent past. So. Probably. Altercations that i've had with my mom. And how. Things i've said to hurt her. I know. Yeah when you. Hurt the ones that are closest to you that sticks. So anytime any one of those situations you know. So when i think my emotional iq has. Ground. So i think. In the past past my emotional cues was stuck. Infant. So. So.

No. My best friend. My best friend. They describe me just like it has a character just very outgoing. You know good sense of humor. But you know. Do we all have our issues you know that they understand when i. I'm going through something or. And i'll get mad about something easily or i could just laugh to right after that you know. Very outgoing smart intelligent strong. The goals that i've accomplished. The past few years. Especially. Mister jobs. Getting the ged getting the job at lax i always wanted. Thank you. Yes. I'm just decisions i made i guess when i was. Younger and laugh even up to the. You know you ever been up to the past. Few years but nothing major in the past few years it's pretty much the decision i made when i was younger you don't younger in life. To stay in school and. I don't know it's not doing the gang. Just to stay in school pretty much. Into a. Control the anger issues i had back then. To do what. To do a. Today. Happy to be here. Going. Exercising going to the gym and working out. Going to the beach hangouts. Family members of magna. Friends. My best qualities. Qualities just-in-time a neat person. I'm not going now i don't know qualities. Parties meaning what. What do you mean by qualities what comes to your mind. Give me a definition of qualities. Lemonade day. Okay bye. I can take her home with me. \n",
      "Yeah there's also. Okay. Craigslist that's why. Alright perfect. Okay. How are you doing today. Doing good. Thank you. I'm from los angeles. I'm great. I live in west los angeles the west side. Alright. Now i live alone so. I love it i'm from here so i grew up here it's natural. The weather. On the weather. Always good never. Never bad there's always something to do. Rarely do moment. Traffic. The traffic is horrible i'll probably traffic is horrible and almost any major city but. I hate the traffic. Not really. I mean i have enough. Things going on here so. If i travel it's usually. Somewhere this within driving distance. I study business. I didn't. No i've been done for a few years so i haven't. Going to school for a while. One of these days i'll go back to graduate school but. My dream job would be to just work for myself and make some money. I don't really have a dream job. Something that i can. I can work under my own terms and get paid decently and. Being a creative creative environment. I don't know i think it's just a matter of finding the right situation so right now at its people are a little conservative about what they want so and how they wanted it so it's a little tougher than. It should be but. I don't know i think when the situation is right i don't think it's too difficult. Yep. I work as an administrative assistant through a temp agency so. It's basically as to get sent out to do. Do desk jobs. Yes and no i mean i feel like. I feel like i could do more but now it works so. I'm pretty close there around so. I really mad. Stupid people just basically doing. Doing anything to annoy me. That's that's the big thing just. Irritating stupid people just do things. Just to provoke. Provoke me for no reason at all. What's a good example. Just random people who think it's funny that just sit there and get a rise out of me just. It doesn't have to be one any specific. Situation is just people who just think it's funny that. I think they're just. Generally sadistic and they just think that. It's funny too. It just probably like it's like poking a stick and an angry dog knowing that they know how to do they just want to push your buttons for no reason so. I don't remember. What does situations i usually try not to remember. I just let it go and it's like the past of the passage. Can not to look back. What do you mean. Okay. What do you do. At what i do to relax i like to run. I like to go to the gym. Listen to music a lot of musician friends so i just i'm usually around musicians so. Anything of that sort i like. I like everything from. Punk rock art the tattoos to. Just anything that's. That's generally art and creative. Who's been deposit. Friends in general. Resume the. We seem to do well and i think they are very inspiring and. Which is sometimes a little bit tough and in a town like los angeles where i think everybody is. On-the-go trying to accomplish their own goals so. They don't. It's sometimes hard to find someone who's going to be uplifting or. Try to be inspiring so. I don't really have anybody in particular but. People kind of brought up things here and there. Yeah it's like instead of. Instead of doing this how about doing that or egg you're good at this why aren't you doing that or something like that. I'm always looking for new opportunities so they always. Point out things that maybe i might i can do differently. Instead of just being negative saying hey. Don't do that and that's no. Why you doing that it's a waste of time. I guess it depends on who you talk to. I'm okay at it i can probably work at that. I don't know i mean i can. I think i can do better at it. Go back to the point about people provoking me so i mean i try not to. Low esteem and let them get under my skin so i just usually try not to. Let it get to me. But. I don't know i guess which a i guess it depends on how i handle my stress. Lately i've been better at it just because i think my situation has been a little bit better. Now. Have you ever been. Now. No. Nothing major. In. Maybe when i was younger i could have. Traveled more. Work towards something that. A better job wise but i mean. Those are all things that i think at any point in life you always think like why could it should have would have done but you know. But then again i think that's natural for anybody i mean. I could i could have become a banker or i could have become a lawyer or doctor made. Thought. 10 times the money that i make now but. But then again i don't like law and i don't like madison so. It wasn't meant to be so. Yeah. I think. I think my. In my life i knew that. There's a lot of things i had there's more displaced in life. So i kind of narrowed it down to. What am i good at and what am i not good at and what am i going to work well or who am i going to work well with and i not work well with. So i kind of. I got it sorted out and then the list kind of. Kind of answered itself so. No it's i don't think it was hard but it was just. But i think it was a real reality check and i think it's it's kind of a good thing cuz. Sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesn't really fit you. Doesn't make sense. It's like trying to shovel around pig into a square. Square hole in psychics. No matter how you try to shove it in it's not going to go in so sometimes it's just. Might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you. Memorable experiences. I think it's just. I don't really have like any one in particular i think. I think every day is almost like a memorable experience whether it's positive or negative i think it's just everything from. Getting it. Just the fact that. I got a job and i can. I can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience maybe for the average person is it sounds stupid but. You know. I think just the fact that. I'm able. I'm able to get this far in life without completely self-destructing is already. An accomplishment so i feel like. I've gotten somewhere. Maybe not tonight maybe not to the point. To the average person they might think like well why aren't you a millionaire but you know what. Not everybody can be a millionaire. Yeah. When is the last time. I want the last time i really felt happy. I don't know i'm not really. Someone who's like. I don't have any real high highs or lows i mean i haven't hit any lowe's so i mean. I don't know i'm usually pretty. I feel like i'm a level person and i'm pretty everyday i feel like if i accomplish one thing that i'm pretty happy so. Just answer the question probably. Probably yesterday i just feel like. If i am able to accomplish something then. Then hey i'm happy. No. I don't really have a best friend but i mean wild answer the question generally friends. I think they would say that i'm pretty outgoing. I pretty. Determined. I'm trying now. I tried i tried to interact as much as possible. I'm always out networking as much as possible. So. I don't know i guess. That's basically. When i think they would describe me as. No problem. Alright. Yeah. I was weird. Play unplugged. \n",
      "Yes. I'm okay. Pennsylvania. Well i was in boston for a couple years and then i moved here about three and a half years ago but i just wasn't satisfied i was calling you in my life. Maybe once or twice last year and got to go back once. A year. Definitely safer and definitely amalur. Why does messi cuz i have lost family back there but ellie is okay i mean everyone loves to climb in here. Not too easy i have two really good friends here and i have a boyfriend at done with for three years so that helps he's from here but it definitely took a bit of adjustment. No. Advertising communications. No i'm currently working and i said i'm not working right now at the moment. I want to be a naturopathic physician. So basically versus western medicine and naturopathic physician is someone who. Help someone with the symptoms and doesn't just treat the symptoms for threesome as a whole person so they look at nutrition they look at diet exercise just a variety of things. To actually get someone to live. A healthier life versus medications are things have a commonly prescribed now in western medicine. Well one of the great things was when i came out here to la i was exposed to the degree which i'd never heard of living on the east coast. Sometimes. Grand very particular about the people like to surround myself with and. I don't like to socialize with a lot of people i mean i tend to like small intimate groups and i don't tend to like to be in larger a bigger groups. When people don't take an account over people's feelings. I usually. Try to go for a walk if i get very irritated. I'm usually really good it really takes a lot for me to spill over into galler become upset. Etsy. I was up with my lawyer and it was about his handling of my case. Yeah it was he's other. And i think they're just a little bit mediocre than at the best lawyers. I have no idea. I'm very trustworthy and loyal. I can't breathe deeply so i like to try to help other people. And i would like to try to cheer people up so. I think that's. Abuse of a. No. Yes. Just a few months ago about in the last 6 months. I was. Experiencing. Mental issues that i've never really came across this for paranoia and anxiety and i knew that it wasn't. I knew that it wasn't that i can overcome it by myself. A lot better i've been doing a lot of yoga and meditation kind of seeing things from a different part of you or not never purview but a different view and. That's how but there's definitely times where i kind of sink back into thinking about the event specially because. The event caused me to stop working. I think i cannot have a difficulty being in public still dealing with anxiety and paranoia about that and that something may happen so. So a lot of times during the day is when it happened so i'm not that comfortable going out there in a day at 10 to go out in the mornings and evenings. And i don't like to go into places where there's only one way in and one way out. Well i've been gradually trying to increase how much i'm outside. I usually just deep breathing my deal other breathing exercises and. I just tried to say that. Basically what i'm thinking or what's going on with me is not real. And that. I just. I try to try to get myself to go into these places more gradually a lot better since. The last couple months but before i. Very much pretty much stayed home. It's been good it's been good to hear someone's feedback. But. I feel like i've gotten more help with just my inner talk was just kind of sitting with myself and journaling. I do. Well i feel more like myself which is huge improvement. And i am more. Cautious in aerogarden some ways about my thoughts. And about my decisions as well. I'm not so. I'm not so you know i just do this and not really think of the consequences of other things that i want in my life. It's gotten better i'm okay i'm better now the first three months it was very difficult i couldn't sleep through the night and i woke up maybe two or three times and would be awake for a couple hours. But now i am sleeping through the night again. Groggy. Feel foggy and out of it. And just low kind of depressed. I think it's been awhile. Working i've been a workaholic. Spending time with my family. Yeah just being outside enjoying nature. Reading. I'm very close. What is that. Well my parents cuz he's always been very supporting and loving. Giving me feedback about my decisions or what i'm choosing to do but allowing me to make my own decisions my own choices in life and then. My sister that just always been very. You guys always checking with me i'm the baby i'm the youngest in the family so they always. Looking out for me and just checking in with me and then. My boyfriend shoots man with this incident happened. He's been very. Usually support of what just letting me kind of have my talk and work things out and. Understanding when i. Feeling and not wanting to go out in public in. And being aware of that that is not so easy for me just to do something like grocery shop for. I'm running errands without having. A lot of anxiety. I'm most proud of. The jobs the work that i've done the people i've helped. Maybe that i took this job where i was assaulted at. That would be it. Going into retail into son safe environment not listening to my gut. What advice would i what. To recklessly pursue your dreams. That there is no such thing as too late or running out of time and. Nintendo every. Moment. Of your life. Not take anything for granted. Etsy. Well cooking i really enjoy really enjoy cooking. So i made. Some roasted vegetables just hate i'm i'm cooking i just really enjoy it we have a garden so. Play al green's i came up and. Chili's. And cauliflower so just using preparing that.

Because i wanted to pursue my acting career. How did you decide to do. Well. It wasn't a hard decision it was just it was the weather was the opportunity. It was the options. More options. The driving has been a pain in the butt not so easy. What are some things you really. Blesse. Besides the weather. I like that. Things are more convenient. I like some of the people here. Better actually from home but. Yeah and i just i like i like that it's a little late back. That's about it. What are some things you don't. I don't like the traffic. I don't like. The gang violence.

I'm getting there i like getting there once i'm at the wherever i'm going i like to actually do the tourist thing it's no places in. People. Okay io i went to i'm france few years ago well many years ago and a little town called carcassonne and was very. It was it was actually really fun but very much like a storybook as far as what i expected to seeing what i actually saw. Like what i remember that i really enjoyed was that at night when everybody closes up like there are no windows in the buildings but. They are the shutters that most places in the united states have inside of windows they have them outside of the windows and there's no glass so you just shut and it looks like everything is abandoned like the buildings are abandoned so pretty cool i like that. I'm borderline. Sometimes i'm shy sometimes i'm outgoing and depends on who. And what the situation is. Sometimes when i'm feeling 10. Hey. What are you doing. Music i turn on music i walk. Through the neighborhoods now. How are you. I'm pretty good at controlling my temper i'm not a. Hot head at all. When was the. Oh it was an ex roommate. It was about my loyalty as a friend. Can you tell me about that. Yeah pretty much co. Thought that because i wanted my rent. What she agreed to pay. That. I was not. Being a good friend that i should just let her live for free. And. That wasn't going to happen. So you know. The loyalty came with letting you stay anyway or letting her stay anyway. Even after she didn't pay me. So that's a friend. I could have kicked her out i didn't. She laughed at the agreed time after she'd. Let me know that she was not going to pay but. She could have arm could have been a bad situation but there was an argument there a real a real one. I wish i had handled that situation differently and followed my first mind when. We agree to be roommates temporarily. And got my money up front. That's what i wish i had done and i just i didn't my mind told me to go along with it. No my mind told me to get the money up front. But i didn't. Tell me about. The hardest decision. I think i have yet to make the hardest decision but so far like. Maybe leaving home. Leaving home when i was years ago when i was like 18. Yeah. How do you feel. I felt like i was abandoning my family that's what i felt but i'm very encouraged me to go on and live my life. Tell me about nevada. Something that i could erase from my memory. Probably. A friend. Who. I was on. Dating. I would like to erase from my memory how he responded to me when i told him my grandmother. Was l. How is your day. I'm it's easy if i'm busy all day and i'm really really tired but actually my mind spend so. It's not that easy actually it's not that easy i have because i have to. Be exhausted. I have to be exhausted. To be exhausted now. It's not really hard you just do a lot of stuff all day long. What are you like when you. Irritable. Up and down. I've been up and down like sometimes i've. Been excited and anxious and on the other side i'm like. What am i doing. Just a nature system want to make some things happen some goals. Man. Getting certain kind of work. And. Having a certain amount of them. Income. And. Just taking care of myself you know the way i think i should. Take care of myself just the physical stuff. Eating right and everything. Yeah. I have. Can you tell me about that. Sometimes i have a lot of. Distracting thoughts that have nothing to do with what i need to be focused on in the moment. And i'm conscious of that unlike of all the things that just popping up in my head why am i thinking about that. How do you cook. I let them happen and then i try to think about other things and phase it out pops back up i phase it out. No. Now. Tell me about the last time. When the roommate moved out. I was really happy when she finally left. I'm probably reading. And maybe go i'll go dancing that would be ideal i can go dancing salsa dancing yeah. What are some things you wish you could.

Deciding to actually be in a relationship that's long-term and. Yeah i wish i had done that earlier. What advice. 20 years ago i would have. Giving giving myself the advice to. Continue. With my schooling. Beyond what i did. And. To be more discerning and my choices of individuals who i allow in my life. What are you most proud. Being a part of the family that i'm apart of. Thank you. Goodbye. I didn't know if it went. \n",
      "Okay. Come. Pretty good kind of. Los angeles. The thing i like about ale the weather. It's not easy to meet people. Well it just feels like. People aren't out very much they're like that movie in crash where people are just in their cars all the time. It feels like that. No. Not too much. Child development. Well i have a son and. I wanted to know how to be a good mom. And so i wanted to know. About the stages. That he would be. Going through. And be able to relate better to him. I am. Kind of i'm trying to get it started again. In the fall. I like the right. I've written some children's books. I've just been doing research looking. And so getting my books published it's only like two that i've written so far but. There. Pretty good i got some good feedback on them for my critique groups. It's about. A little boy that surrounded by people that are jerks. And he tries. 2. Not become a joke with him. Like i really. It goes through a lot of moods. Dealing with the people in his life. No. I've had some. Issues the nervous breakdowns actually. And right now my son is staying with his dad so. No i was single mom it was the hardest thing. I think in the world. How do i cope. Right now. I didn't have very many. Coping skills are mechanisms so. That was. The problem. It's so. Spontaneous. The stuff that comes out of kids mouth sometimes and the stuff that they do and. This brings a smile to your face. Well my son was younger. Once we were just sitting around the house and. He comes and he starts doing my hair and he says to me. Mom i want you to put on some lipstick and high heels and ponytails. So you can go out and get married and find a boyfriend. So. Damn pretty spontaneous things like that happen. That mike is telling me i need to not be single anymore. The hardest thing. Not wanting to screw it at. Have a lot of stress and pressure. That. Every little thing is going to be in make a difference in matter. And what kind of person like it turns out to be. And. So. It's a lot of stress on yourself. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. I'm different from my mom. Because i'm a little bit more. Tolerant of that spontaneous interaction. I welcomed it you know i welcome. Getting to know who my child is right now. Not try to mold them into somebody that i want them to be but jess. See them become the best. Child that they can be the best adult that they can be. Without. Molding them in that direction necessarily. Into a different person. Say it again. Who's someone that's a positive influence. I don't really have anybody. Like that. Well. I've tried. Can meditate sometimes but i don't really stick with it. Often enough. I've tried. Thule go for a walk. But i don't always do that. And it always stick with it. So. That's about it. I'd say. A little below average meaning. That i get angry. More than most people do icing. That's right. It is on the telephone i was arguing with my husband. We have my sister lives with us. She lives with us in a very small room with. A small apartment i should say. And she's got four people living in one room. So. It's kind of stressful it's really crowded. My husband is stressed out about it. You know i'm just saying to him that. I told you so i told you if my sister moved in here. There's going to be a mess in the house. And she's going to be asking for things you don't really want to do. That's just how my sister is so the house is messy and it's crowded. And everyday they're asking for brides and my husband. He's. Avoiding coming home because. All these people are home and he doesn't want to be there anymore. Add i just saying that. He's going to have to find a way to deal with it because. He asked for it in my opinion. Where does. Oh. I've got time to bombay right now. But thought i might is. Losing custody of my son. Right now like. I've been arguing with my stepmom. My step-sister. For a long time about. My son and how they treat him and how i want him to be treated. Fake. They don't have any boundaries. And i believe that boundaries are important in establishing who's the adult who's the child. They let my child boss them around and stuff. Anyways because of this. They're going to be testifying against me in the custody trial saying that. Yeah there any saying that i'm not a good mom. Because i believe in having boundaries and we have very different. Ideas about child. Brazing. She's my stepmom she's my dad's 5th wife. She's. She really does it she's really far removed from. How i was raised and i want to raise my child. More similar to how i was raised where you we had some independence and we had some boundaries that we knew. What the rules were and what was expected of us. With my stepmom she invents no rules she has no expectation she just wants him to run wow. And have everything that he wants and that's fine with your grandparent but the problem is that i live with him sometimes. And when i'm in the same house with them they should be following my rules. Anak. Try to go and break all of my rules. Anyway. Yam. And that moment. Just really frustrated because they don't listen to me. I fell. Disrespected i feel. Like invisible. I feel. Just angry. That. They're taking away my right to parrot. And it's something that i worked really hard to do. I went to school and i studied child development. I read all the magazines and i read the books and i really. I know. What i'm talkin about i feel confident and my parenting skills are my parenting abilities. To have these people that have it done the same thing and worked as hard as i have to be a good parent. Try and tell me that i'm a bad parent. It's really. Hard to believe so i feel very disrespected. Unacknowledged. Angry frustrated all those. I take i take benadryl to help me sleep. And i'm. So. My doctor gave me that. Give you benadryl told me i could take it to help me sleep. Last night i was crying. Before i went to sleep. So what time do you start start. Running through your head at night when you're in bed. But i tried to push them out and then i got up and i took my benadryl so i can go to sleep more easily. Yeah i'm always thinking about my son. I wish you was with me. And how unfair everything is it's happening. And like i don't deserve. Throughout my son taken from me because i'm a really good mom. Ditto. And i'm too hard on myself so. I am a good mom. And i feel confident that i'm a good mom. Yes. I don't really have the money to take care of my son like my dad descends dad does. He has more money than me. And right now i'm trying to be okay with it because. I know he can do more for him. Financially than i could. That doesn't mean i'm not a good mom. I'm pretty depressed. I'm on antidepressants. Take wellbutrin. I've been on it for a couple weeks now. I think they're working i don't know. I'm not as. Down as i was i mean i got here today i got dressed and i'm here today so. Dot-dot-dot. My husband complains a lot. He says. I'm not the same person. That i was when he married me. He said it was fun and i was positive and. I was all these other optimistic things that's another thing he was on the phone telling you last night and. And. I'm not those things anymore. Which is true. I mean we got married a year ago. And that my son was taken shortly after and it was just such. A shark. And. I've just been trying to get back from it. But it's been hard. Did i think i had a problem before i found out. Found out what. Oh. Yeah like crying a lot sometimes. I cry all the time. It doesn't take much for me to grab just crying thinking about crying but. Play. Their family would invite be. Family events. And i would go and just. Just cry because my there. Orem. Put it down. It's just all the crying i think. Like i said my husband. Letting me know that i'm not the same person. So. He's disappointed. Did i feel bad even that i'm about to same person that he knew. I feel bad about that too. Another thing i'm feeling bad about. Ditto. Yes i do. Okay. I feel like the therapist useful. Yeah it's nice to talk about your problems i go in there and i cry every week so i need to have a set time every week where i can go in and cry. That's i mean it's a release to be able to cry sometimes i feel better afterwards. Yeah. And she helps me make. Decisions you know. Help me to be more proactive in my life. Swell. I'm looking for. Jobs and things like that and she gives me ideas of why don't you work here why don't you work there have you thought about this or that. You know and then. She said something about. But if you go back to school then. So i went and applied to go back to school. You know i'm not doing. Much with my life and. Sitting around all day isn't helping my depression any either. So i'm trying to find a work and i applied for college. In the fall i got accepted to dominguez hills. So i may be going back to school in the fall. Right now i'm still looking for a rare. But she helps me with that kind of stuff just giving me ideas. That life isn't over. But they're still more you know i could be doing. Just like life yeah. Everything's always. Bittersweet. I don't know. Last time it was really happy. I don't know. My ideal weekend. Oh. I don't have a lot of money cuz i'm not working right now so really my weekends are just sped. Baby maybe. But i can't really. I can't pay much attention when i'm reading and i can only read a couple of chapters. But lately i say that's what i've been doing is reading. Something i read. Okay. I need to go to usc. They have these nights were. They have things like book signings or poetry and art is called visions & voices. Thought i'd to go out to their events. And i usually enjoy those. About 2 weeks ago. Deborah harkness was there doing a book signing for. A discovery of witches. Just like i said i'm trying to be a writer so i try to go especially to the book signings.

Brief and start my meditation process. How hot is it. It could be hard if you don't practice it everyday or if you're not able to quiet your mind. However a few meditate for long time it becomes a practice like going to the trim or drinking daily water you can naturally learn to meditate. How are you at control. I think pretty good. When was the last time. I typically do not argue. I don't remember any instance of arguing with anyone recently. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differ. Maybe being on the freeway and taking the wrong exit. I would have probably gps or not being overconfident. Tell me about the hardest. Hardest decision i've ever had to make.

Listen and listen i'm just as all people i need. What you study at school. I went to school. I have two degrees. And business management. Degree and also i have a language degree. How did you decide. I learned languages when i was very little opportunity to travel. And it was easier for me to keep on learning languages. And the business part i enjoy interacting with people creating new ideas. Innovating. So i believe that's where my interested in business came from. Are you still working. If i am. What's your dream job. A dream job one that wouldn't have probably challenges everyday. I want that i could. And i just come to the office and everybody and everything would be perfect bed. It's not real so i think one of the main things about having a job is enjoying those challenges. What are you most proud. Very proud of myself. My accomplishments. And i'm also very proud of my family. And my friends. And how they have. Achieve. And overcome their obstacles. I'm sure i have a friend of mine who is now a new york state university. She had quite some challenges trying to get there and funding her location and now she is. And not only in the school but she has has acquired. Some funding for education through a lot of writing letters and petitions and thing she did in order to conquer her dream to be in school so very proud of her. That's great. Thank you. Goodbye. That was cool. \n",
      "Okay. Maker. Yes. Okay. Virginia. I wanted to live somewhere different than virginia with a little bit more diversity. Once a year maybe. At song. It's a lot slower and there's a lot less to do there. I wanted to live somewhere different and. A nicer warmer climate and somewhere where there's a lot more to do and. There's a lot more going on. For me it was really easy cuz i wanted some it was very different and i wanted something different. I like. I like all the things to do like the museum's i like. The beaches in the mountains and all the. Hiking and all the free things to do. People don't appreciate what they have here that just come here and want to take something but they don't want to give anything back in. Bad drivers. Not as much as i'd like to i. Travel whenever i can but usually can't afford to that much. Well i like taking. I like taking pictures a lot and i just like. Exploring new places my wife and i like to see you. Wildlife in. Hiking. Monuments and just seeing different areas. Well. We. We've got we went to central california we'd like to be able to go. More internationally places but that takes awhile to afford so we've gone more locally so we went to. We went to hearst castle in the sea the sea. Elephant seals and things like that. I guess. I guess our palm springs trip for our anniversary we did the. Hair did the tram in the nice hotel on the jacuzzi and romantic dinner and it was a good time overall. Guess somewhere in between. English and film. Well i am. Was told i needed to go to college in i hadn't quite decided what to do yet so i just. Pick something i like to do for the time being. Well. Wish i had. Not been pressured said more time to figure out what i wanted to i might have done something different like physical therapy but. I know ivan. Teaching gymnastics which is something i used to do before. I needed to not starve and. It did it. It didn't end up being as bad as i thought it would be so i went for it ended up being kind of fun. Dream job is to have money and not have to work for it. Overall pretty good. Don't remember what about that it probably would have been. Few weeks ago with my wife. Well anyone that i've ever. Actually gotten upset and. Yelled always. Wish i wouldn't do that but sometimes when someone's not listening it drives me crazy. Now if i just. Saying something over and over and they're just. Clearly not listening it makes me really upset. I don't know i. I spend a lot of time on them but. I don't i don't know what the hardest one is cuz it if i decide to go with something and you know it's usually for a good reason. I guess i feel. Guilty about moving to california and that i left my family in virginia. I mean. I know i shouldn't but they always seem to miss me and even though they don't like. Living there you know i'm the one that moved away so it's like i abandoned them. Well i mean. I don't miss virginia but i do miss them so i guess a little hard. Good relationship with my. With my wife with my in-laws with my mom dad and sister there's. No problems everyone gets along well. Very close. Mean anything anything where someone. It gets hurt either physically or otherwise. Depends on how much exercise i have. Get a lot of exercises pretty easy if i don't it's not. Kind of like right now just a little bit. Swelling out of it but. Not really. Two different otherwise. I'm just kind of run-down cuz my um. My mother-in-law's is dying and we just spent like three days. In the hospital i'm going to go back after this so not a lot of time to. Sleep. Just song. Just just slower in. More tired and. Little more out of it that's all. No. No. Usually just when i'm. Having. Having a fun day either on my own or with my wife that's. It's pretty easy for me just getting outside and. And and hiking or exercising snot hard for me. I'm not sure maybe. Maybe. Like. Eccentric but in a good way. Hopefully. No. 2. Be careful with your. To be careful with your. Job to make sure you could keep from being injured and two. I don't know just just your normal. Your normal kind of. Older kind of wisdom. Not much to say really everyone realizes things when they get older they wish they had when they were younger. I wish i could get rid of my back injury so i could get back into shape like i used to be. That's awesome. The biggest thing right now. Not much to say just hurt my back at work and. I just like to get past it cuz it's. Ain't no holding me back from doing a lot of things that's all. Smile like you used to do gymnastics and trampoline and used to be a lot more active workout more. Now i can only work out a little bit cuz it hurts too much. Probably like during that. During the day going going on a hike or to a park with my wife and. Enjoying taking pictures and wildlife and exercising and then. At night you know if we. Watch a movie or go dancing or. Something like that. Proud of them. Proud of moving here and they came here without knowing anyone and. I was at a point where i could have stayed in virginia and gotten comfortable and. You know ended up doing something i regretted but i came out and i've always thought that was a good decision. My parents my grandparents my wife. Most people in my life have been. \n",
      "Yeah. I'm doing pretty okay thanks for asking how are you. I'm from here in la i grew up in the san fernando valley. Yeah. Well i like the the diversity of people the different kinds of food you can eat i like. The outdoor opportunities i grew up close to the hills so i did a lot of hiking. Camping is pretty close by abs on snowboarding i like. Did the familiarity i think you know it's it's a big city and you know i'm pretty familiar with having lived here for so long then. I like that too. Probably the number one thing that everybody says i don't like kathak i don't like being stuck in traffic i don't like. The long commute steven nina for short distances. Nina gets really hot in the summer at times nina. That i could send it being a little slightly cooler when i gets to speak tiki butt. That's fine. Well my dream job that's a great question i asked. I think my dream job would probably be you know maybe being able to travel and somehow. Make money off of that profit off it you know maybe gainful employment office traveling but. It's almost an unrealistic dream since i don't know if i would actually want to do that but. If i had to pick some kind of dream existence and traveling getting paid to travel and meeting new people trying new things. And being able to make a living out of that would be pretty fun. Well i like like a mention what i like by the way i like trying different kinds of food different cuisines so i think trying authentic cuisines in different places and meeting different kinds of people seem different ways of life would be. That is what i like about traveling i like experiencing new things. I think that'd be nice so you know despite the fact i say i like the familiarity of la. There's also. Fun in discovering you think so i think when i travel that's that's why i like to do just checking things out. I would like to be you know if i could make a living. One of my trips okay well let's see the the last. Trip. Took. I think of what 11 more exciting trip. Well my my family is from eastern europe so one of the trips i took with my parents when i was 14 was i went to. Austria hungary and romania and you know getting to see some of those old guy been a few times before but it was when i was little so i don't really have too much primary plus i didn't really process things quite the same as when i was kind of more of age. So i got to see you know my family is old you know hometown you know we have a family. Like. So i got to see that than just these old buildings and just a different way of life. I really like that you know seeing my parents old friends you know and. So that was pretty funny was very different was like really my first time being taken away from my. My home environment tina i left him know the school year so is just like going from me no suburban america 2. Traveling around kind of you know taking these old trains and seen these castles and he's old like hundreds of year old towns and. I don't know if it was for everyone you know i don't know it would be great for everybody by i really enjoyed it. That's that's a good question i do. I probably one of the things i do is either turn on like a rerun of a sitcom i used to watch the office a lot so. I kind of know when that's on so i'll turn that on you know just kind of zone out a little bit too you know. Characters in and hearing jokes that are still funny for some reason. Maybe like eating some kind of comfort food you know i try not to eat too much fast food at all but. Like in and out i really like going there so if i have to unwind. Once every few months maybe i'll do that. Or i really like to read. Especially like i'll read the day's events you know that. really. Relaxes me for some reason even if it's reading about something some conflict going on someone the world ii still all be the headlines in. I really like to know what's going on that kind of centers me. So i really enjoy that that's may i do to relax. I would say i'm pretty great at it i'll do i do i think my nature makes it pretty easy pranks that pretty easy i don't get very upset easily at also. I ate so much of a challenge to control my temper. Yeah i don't really have anger issues that it's difficult for me to get angry so i don't. I don't i don't know that much trouble without at all. Last time i argued with somebody was probably. I don't even know i a mean small disagreement encino i might have had with family or friends about. Things but just a full-on argument i guide. I can't remember it's been years i don't really argue too much i try to avoid conflict. Much as possible in my in my personal life i don't. Receive anything to be gained by it i kind of naturally repel away from it so i don't. How much to say about arguing. I feel guilty about i would say that you know something. Sometimes i don't really. I feel like i may be out and made the most of my potential yet in life i think that i could definitely do more despite the fact i work a lot. I i feel like i there's always more opportunity out there that they were missing i feel like sometimes downtime i feel a little bit guilty about that because there's always something that i could be doing that i'm not even if it's just putting away the laundry that that's been. I took out the giants been sitting there or. Running late i really don't like running late although it happens more that like to write i don't know why i feel guilty about that i don't like keeping people wait waiting because it makes it feel like my time is somehow more valuable than theirs which is obviously not true. Nothing immediately comes to mind.. Well the last car accident i got into it was a few years ago i guess i wish it hadn't happened. i wish i. Could erase my memory but i ate. Was. Driving in rush-hour traffic and you know i thought the cars in front of me where we're going you know at least for a little 10-15 feet but it turns out that that stops. You know slowed. Rear end collision but it was still very important i was just you know i just felt like i was paying attention one second and the next second you know i was just like. Reaching for something on left in the passenger seat and then i ate i smacked into the car in front of me in. I wish that hadn't happened absolutely i know it's a minor thing but. It was just really unfortunate the timing of it was very bad enough for me financially any of those people i got into an accident with we're fine but you know they they didn't ask for anything beyond repairing the damages but that it was just a horrible timing. So i wish i had that happened. That sucks it did suck. I'm over now but it did that suck. Well i'm a pretty good sleeper although naturally wired to be up later at night so unfortunately my unfortunately my job allows me. Fortunate pretty flexible schedule but at the same token i wish i could wear like hardwired to go to sleep earlier because i just i wind up staying up. Till 1 or 2 every night and. It's just too late you know even though i can get a full 8 hours or whatnot of sleep it's not always at night time you know half of my sleep is like in the. Colorly daylight hours i wish i were. More. Able to sleep and i'll go to sleep at like 10 or 11. And then sleep in the wake up earlier as opposed to. Going to sleep later and waking up later. Pretty feeling pretty good. i've been i have no complaints physically and you health-wise i feel good. Yeah my relationships with my my family and friends are good. Everything is great so far i have absolutely no no real complaints as far as how i'm feeling about myself or anything like that. No no i've been fairly consistent with my behavior in my thoughts i think that. Everything is been been pretty okay pretty steady no no nothing traumatic nothing. Kind of resurfacing for the past nothing of the sort has happened there is happening. No. I think there's plenty of things everybody regrets yeah yeah there's there's plenty of things. In my life like i said i. I do regret that you know maybe not trying harder in my younger days he know i. Does it. kind of early twenties where i i didn't work for a while i just. I hung out with a lot of friends yeah i guess it was like the proverbial bad crowd you know none of us work we just you know we. We got high everyday. Or it seemed like every day i don't know it was just kind of like a throwaway. of my life. I would say that. It's important to. To take engage with the world i think i think i kind of dropped out from the world a little bit i think it's all so i would say that it's important to. Recognize the people around you for what they are you knowing what what kind of potential do you know if you try tivities they you can expect from. The people you surround yourself with i think that i would say also that. Kind of try to focus on what i wanted to do with my life as opposed to just thinking well you know things will work out which. Eventually they do but i think that you know there's a bit of lost time with that. That approach is kind of fatalistic. And i think that i would say you know just try to concentrate you know you know not not everyone works on the same schedule and life isn't a race but i would say that. Is it important to have a goal in mind or some kind of. You no idea for what what you want out of life as opposed to just kind of waiting and. Thinking of things will fall into place. Well i. I guess some people i i don't especially. Take even constructive criticism particularly well for some reason i think that at least myself i sort of have things figured out although i am wrong about that. So i think just maybe in terms of like a group work that done professionally or academically you know when. Munson my work is. Can i pick the part or or scrutinized. I don't deal well with that and i taken more personally than i should. I was told about a year-and-a-half ago i was working on a research project at work and somebody would much less expose three of us working on something and then they brought in another pair of eyes just to go over it and there was somebody. Just out of college you know. Went over what we had done and. You know just kind of rewording things and it it seems like cosmetic changes were being made just for the sake of changing things and. I cannot take personal offense to that just because i thought i had a lot more experience and more education and. It was unnecessary that you know i thought the whole thing was a waste of time and you know i just. I didn't think that she was somebody that was qualified to attend this so you redo all our work or or even to. Not to redo it but 22 edited or two. Proofread i guessed it to make any kind of. You know qualitative changes i just thought that it was a really bad idea and i thought that you know i should have viewed it this way but i thought that. The fact that they brought in somebody with almost no experience you know it was kind of like an affront to us would work on it on this project but. You know it wasn't a call. Most memorable experiences. I guess the first thing that comes to mind is 1 mi. The first real trip i took by myself i took the the amtrak to to new mexico and i was out there exploring things. For about 10 days on my own. So that was kind of the longest. . tylenol that point i was in my. 23 maybe at the time that i. I'd really just been on my own completely cut off from everyone i was in parts of new mexico where there's no cell phone reception at the time. It is very memorable because i was on it on my own i feel like i was really you know exposed to the things i wouldn't have seen if i had to had traveling companions of fun. I've been very happy recently i-84 that i'm getting married in a few months i got engaged on labor day 2012 this whole process you know. We kind of progress very quickly realize we would recognize where we were so i've been a pretty. Happy state the past it's been 11 months now but yeah so i think that the day we got engaged and then we we shared it with our family i think those have been. Very happy times new years was happy you know happy. of my life right now so. Thank you. With a sort of. Sets of humor that maybe not everybody gets i'd say also. You know. Helpful, relaxed. Intelligent. Likes to recycle i know that's a subject that they would say. Hey. What else i think that. Best friend might say that i like animals i've always had dogs and cats so they might describe me as a people person i mean an animal person sees me. Also. You know fairly easygoing you know flexible with with plans. I'd say one of the most proud of in my life. Well i'm pretty happy with the level education i've gotten i'm also going back and starting the fall i'm starting a ph.d program some happy about that happy about you know breaking so my bad habits from the past that say if i'm proud of anything it's that. You don't have a strong faith relationship i go to church off and i'm very happy about that i don't have prizes the right word but. My relationship to my family and friends are all very good. I'd say maybe the fact that. It's a lot different than my life is a lot different than it was about 10 years ago you know that the change i'm happy and proud of that. No problem have a good day thank you. Goodbye. \n",

Sort of wish i had planned. For better. Future for the for the bird. Only because now i sort of wish the bird. Was. Closer to me. Tell me about it. I would say. I get into arguments with. People close to me friends. And. Sometimes i. I don't handle them well. I. And more. Reactive. So i wish i'd like to see myself improve on that. No at least not no not any sort of legal trouble but the. I think it's you know it's kind of. Not the way that i would like to have handle it. Guess the hardest decision was about. 2. Of. How to. Proceed with. Moving forward on. A. Job opportunity. I had to. Decide whether. If i would. Suffer more emotional pain by leaving. My family and whether the financial gain and. Knowledge. Of that experience would. Would over outweigh the benefit. Yes. Yes i am. Well i small family but. Have a mother and a. Sister and a brother. And two younger nieces. The older third third grown adults. It's a good relationship. And. Things could be better. Sometimes it's sorted. Difficult. Pain. Staking. Have relationships at times. There's a. Some days i'm. I need time for myself and i. Would rather give the time to. Other people rather than the take time for myself which has been my experience. And so. That has caused me me. A lot of emotional. Pain a little bit spiritual. Anxiety about my future if i continue to do that sort of thing. There's so many things about you i don't know anything about you. I would say this few. But of recent. Things are going pretty good. Can really say there's anything as of yet that i would really want to change or or have anything to regret on. Like remember. It's been pretty good. And.

I wish i could say i was good at it but usually i i tend to have outbursts. Every once in awhile. When things are getting too chaotic. At my house and i am feeling very underappreciated. I will. Have a. Birthstone. Anger. Yeah my husband doesn't appreciate that and i've never done it at work or in a social situation. But at home with my family i've done it. And then instead of. Recognizing that i'm sad about it. My husband tends to get mad at me for being mad. And then that escalates and. Sometimes i just end up walking out the door. Or going to my room. I'm sorry. I usually after i have an outburst. And i isolate myself for a little bit. I can come back relaxed. And deal with the situation. In a. More. Call manor. I'm sometimes it's very hard but i've gone to the point where i know just to. Stop and get myself out of there. And then go take some deep breaths. And then really try and figure out what i'm feeling. Why i'm being angry why why am i being. So tense. And then be able to verbalize that. Well it happens a few times when i start getting. I've had a very tense day. And things haven't gone right. I tend to have outbursts in the kitchen while i'm making dinner. And the kids are all home and they're asking me questions about their homework. Or they're turning on the tv or and my husband. Bothering me about things that i just don't need to think about right then. And. One time i just said okay everyone out of the kitchen leave me alone. Get out. Let me finish dinner. And nobody would. And i just it just had more pressure building up and building up and actually took one of the pots and just banged it against the stove really hard just like get people to pay attention to what i was saying and actually made a dent in my stove which is still there so that that i should have. Walked out sooner and taking my deep breath before i did that. It was probably when i was pregnant with my first child. I wasn't married. I had a very good friends. Oh i was i was. 32 at the time. So i was you know it wasn't ian i think if i was younger i probably would have decided to have an abortion. But at that point in my life i'm like okay i'm going to have this child. And i had. I got pregnant by the man i actually married and still married to. But we'd only been dating like 3 months. And i was living with. But a good friend of mine who had been in the peace corps with. I'm and she inside didn't know this guy very well. I didn't know if we could raise a child together. I didn't know if i wanted to get married and raise a child with somebody else. I'm and my friend suggested that we raise the child together. Even suggested moving to costa rica to raise the child together. And so it was a lot of. Huge decisions. That we're going to determine the rest of my life. And i. Made the decision based on. More common sense and practicality. But i don't regret that decision. I think i made a good decision. To marry my husband. They're older now my my oldest is 17. He is at davinci science. At school and he's very much into engineering. He is getting his pilot's license. Which i'm very proud of them for the my daughter is. 15. And she loves acting. Chianti other boyfriends. Who. They see just once a week at church basically. And they text each other constantly. She's a very very typical fifteen-year-old. And then i had a twelve-year-old. He is extremely active and is in constant motion and always making noises but i love him dearly. He isn't a rock climbing and there's a rock climbing gym near our house. So he has a membership there so he goes over there. Rock climbs amazon a daily basis. No. I find it extremely difficult i wasn't. My mother had a varied if my dad died when i was young. And my mother kind of disconnected. When that happened. So i didn't have a very warm or loving. Relationship with my mother or. Growing up and i basically raised myself i was. I'm kind of on my own from a very young age. I mean she was at the house but. Really had no interaction with her. They really didn't have. Parenting skills. That you know must be fardar maze with. I know what not to do. But sometimes it's very difficult and. I see my friends that has you know these. Varian nate parenting skills is very warm and you know they're making cookies and everything's organic and they know everything and know their house is always perfect. And it's like i'm just not that person. So i i. I tried and be. I think i am a very good mother. But i'm not. A typical mother. I think i'm more. More creative. A lot of times i and we do a lot of things. But it's not a warm fuzzy cozy. Kind of thing. Actually when we go camping it's more. I'm more homey when i go camping then i am at home. I think i'm more tense when i'm at home. But i'm trying to pack through meditation and things if that's what i'm trying to become. Calmer and more patient. I think my patience is what. I need to work on the most. And they've been an insomniac on my life. I remember the child laying in my bed watching the stars go across the bedroom window and. I haven't slept well for a long time. But i realize that if i exercise. And i do something with my brain intellectually during the day. Have to be. Physically tired and intellectually tired. To sleep well. I'm in that sometimes that's hard to do. And solon jose stayed stay awake beating. Are we till midnight. And i'll try and go to sleep. And usually i don't get back up even if i wake up at 3 again. And things of that sort but i'll try to go back to sleep. Yesterday i didn't feel so good i was. I think a lot of it has to depend on the weather and was all cloudy and gray yesterday. Cuz i planned planned on working at may garden. And then i'm making a butterfly garden in my front yard. So i had some more planting to do and i just cooked them kind of feel like doing it. So. For the throat about and wasted a lot of time yesterday but today i feel really good. I feel more positive i feel more energy. I don't know i just got a new mattress actually that. Hasn't really help me sleep. But. It was really good because i've needed one for a really long time. And i was just kind of excited about being delivered it delivered and in setup and in that sounds like through mundane. But it was. You know just like. I'm finally doing something positive cuz it's it's something that i put off doing and put off doing put off doing and it was like finally. They're in concrete and it's like i've done this task that i can check off my list. But also i took the kids camping over spring break and. We just had a fabulous time and we sat around telling stories and. The campfire and making some more as and things like that. Those kind of times make me very happy. I don't know. I think she. Believe that i'm. More intellectual and smarter than i think that i am. A time so she comes to me with a lot of issues. She always she always solicit advice from me she thinks i give her good advice. And when she doesn't know what to do so she'll ask me. And then sometimes she just cause me to run things by. I just like to complain about because i'm sympathetic. Or empathetic and. I just i'm just there to listen. And i don't need to give her any. I think i could listener in. Good advice giver. I procrastinate alot. I start projects and i don't finish them. So that's what i'm working on right now is finishing up a lot of projects that i started over the past few months. A lot of them are really creative projects and. I'm very enthusiastic about them when i when i start them and i'll get. Almost finished. And then. I don't know what happens i just completely lose interest. Sometimes i think it's because i'm afraid to finish them. Which sounds a little strange but. I am working on that. To get this done. Oh gosh. Not following through on the opportunities i had when i got out of the peace corps there was a lot of things that i could go into going to get my master's degree. Monograms and things of that sort. But instead i got pregnant got married. And i had a wonderful job that i really liked and really enjoyed. But then when i got pregnant the second time is right at a time. Where i had to fight for a directorship. And i realized my limitations where i couldn't be pregnant and have this child and and do everything i needed to do to get a directorship. And so i really wish so i resigned. And i wish i'd stuck with that. Cuz then i would have had a much more fulfilling and rewarding in. Solid career. Not. Base decisions on emotions. Sometimes i am. And not have some really bad bosses. The jobs were wonderful. But. My ego got in the way. And i would have told myself to let go of that aspect of the job that go of the. They. Egotistical. Reactions that i had. To the bosses and concentrate on the job. And doing that really well. My children actually. And also my peace corps experience was. Chess. Phenomenal. And. People are actually really interested in that in there like an all that. They actually know someone who actually did that. So that that's. I always thought i was a little girl. My neighbor was one of the first people to go into the peace corps when it first started. And i always said i want to do that one day i want to do that one day i want to do that one day then finally got to the point where i either have to shut up or do it. So that. That was. One of my powder. Experiences. Okay. Thank you. \n",
      "Okay other than this. Laryngitis i have. A cleveland ohio. In. 79. Once. A year. Or less. Other than a lot more to do here. They're little. More narrow-minded. Back there and republican. Well originally show business. But probably to get away from. Cleveland. It was very difficult. I'm not used to. Change i don't like change very much. Having to. Meet new people and. Figure out how to make a living. Well. I like. The. Different opportunities you have the different the health consciousness. The movies. The variety of things you can do. The places you can go. The weather. The driving the congestion. Some of the. Superficial attitude. Importance. Well not a lot but i do. I just came back from vegas to. Visit relatives. We met there. And i'm going to mexico. Next month. Well. Seeing the different. Cultures like i've been to europe. Grease france. Italy. I like going to places such as mexico or it's going to be sunny and just lying out and. Last year i went to arizona. I never saw sedona that was really. And experience. A peaceful. About sedona. Well sedona ceviri. Energetic. Place and i thought it was desert-like flat. Kind of desert looking but it was. Very rocky and when you land in flagstaff there's he's beautiful. Pine trees. And. The elevation is high and then coming into the donut was very beautiful and. And after a day. Pain in my back went away. That i had there for months. So anyhow this even though we went to bed late and got up early you had the energy. So is really. Very mystical. In life. Or incident in life. Well being on stage in boston. And that was great. Hi i love doing that. Just. Being with friends and laughing. Borrow some of my highest. Well. I don't know if a particular situation but when i when i decorate for special events. And. I worked with somebody on a regular basis and we would just. Find humor in everything. Laughing. And. I can't think of particular situation. What we were laughing at but. Just being with somebody whose in tune with. My sense of humor and. Guess. My jokes and. You know i get his. Enjoying. Batman. Speech and drama. I am a traitor. Oh no not now. I always was interested in. Musical comedy when i was. Child i would. Sing along the records in my living room. And i was always inquires. In school and. Then when i. Went to high school i joined the drama club. And i just always had an interest and i always had a. A big personality. Well. I don't know if i have a dream job anymore. I'm 60 and. I don't know if i. Have aspirations anymore to towards doing anything. Right now i just rather not work just. You relax and travel but. I like being creative. And in any way i can i like independence. And. I kind of have that right now so. I'm okay. Well i. I watched my favorite television shows that i've recorded. And i also am a buddhist i've been a buddhist for. Gosh since 19. 88. And. I'm. That district leader in my community. And we have meetings and that. Really helps to. Center me and. Bring out my higher self. So if i get tense or nervous. I chant. Sometimes okay sometimes not. A lot yes yes. Less and less though it's been happening less and less. But. Yeah sometimes it's got its. Created difficult. Well. I can't remember an argument i remember getting angry like. Was just when i was on my trip in vegas i was driving. And the gps said stay in the left lane and i stayed in the left lane but when i get off the freeway it brought me onto the ramp that went back onto the freeway. About four miles out of our way and i just. I got very angry for about. Thirty seconds and then i had to calm myself down and say okay alright so we're going to be late and i had to talk myself. Out of it. So it wasn't really an argument with anybody but. I feel kind of. Bad that i. You mean in my life. Manny's. Yes. There's so many. I just wish that when somebody tells me disappointing. Information. Like. Then i'm going to use me on a job or something. That i would. Take an attitude. That. I'll find something better it's okay and. Move on as opposed to feeling what's wrong with me. And. You know did i do something wrong and then get angry at them and. You know that. Polo. Thought process that really doesn't help the situation. Can i do that more often. But i. Since i started chanting. But. It doesn't you know. I'm not always in my high life condition where. I can do that. I find a lot of situations. Like in a what. Television to buy. But. I guess the hardest decision would be one that had the biggest consequence. And. Or leaving my comfort. Place. If the decision meant that i had to leave my comfort place. That would be a very difficult decision for. And probably. Leaving a relationship. Very hard because. It your i get dependent. On that relationship. So i usually. Live it out until. It's 48 hours. Believe or something and it's very hard for me. To make that decision that this isn't right and i have to move on. So what i usually do is i don't make the decision. And i end up suffering. Longer. Can we move on. Well. It's hard. Because i don't know if it's because i have pain. In my back. And neck. But. It's difficult for me to stay asleep. I don't get it. A deep sleep. But. Because of. So it's hard to say because right now i have this cold and i've had it for 2 weeks so i've been taking nyquil. And that's what putting me to sleep so. I have been. Sleeping. Better because of it. But last night i woke up coughing so it's it's hard to tell. But before that all happened. I was. Finding it difficult to stay asleep. And so therefore i'm tired during the day and. Sometimes i'm groggy sometimes i'm irritable. But. I'm not really sure if it's related to this pain in my back or. Emotional things are. I'm sorry could you repeat that. Have i studied. Changes in my behavior. But no. I was not. No. Oh i was like happy last week you know. Well. I. Was going to. Vegas to. Meet my family was my. My family is flying in from cleveland to. We have a. Relative. Vegas. And i drove with my friend. And it was my brother-in-law 70th birthday. So. We all went and. Had a good time in vegas. I was struggling through my cold but. But it was fun it was nice. Well. Are they think i'm funny. They feel that i say it like it is. Then they all say they understand me so. People that don't understand me i think sometimes don't know how to take me. Cuz i'll. I'll say something sometimes it come up come across sarcastic. But yet that's just the way i talk. So. My. The. Anger that sometimes wells up in may. You know i just. But although that that really made me i think a lot of the person that i am in all the all of your. Experiences make you who you are. And how you handle them. Makes you who you are and if you don't have those. Lowe's you don't really know what hyzaar. So i don't. I can't really go back and regret and i wish certain things didn't happen whatever but really what matters is today and now and how you handled today. And i wish that. Why can't i don't wish i know that i will have less of these. Moments where i. Desperate out. Anger something. I just wish that would happen more less. That anger parts what happened less. And they are so. I guess it will. Don't give up hope live in the moment. And. Everything will. Everything will work out. Everything will work out. And. If you believe that. Then you really have nothing to fear. The fact. That now. And for the past. 20 years 20 some years i've been. Cultivating myself and i've been i've become. Amor. Compassionate person. And i'm able to. Understand people better. And. See that. You know there's. They're suffering too. And. That. If you if you treat people. From that respect that there. They have their problems too and their suffering with their problems to you able to live a better life because. You're not allowing that to affect. Not taking it personally. And at the same time you're becoming more compassionate person and when you're more compassionate. You're happy and. Life is happy. \n",
      "Okay. Yes. Pretty well. From new york. To go to college. Plug to san diego to go to college. And then later to la. Aerospace engineering. It was that was really good at math and science and i had an interest in airplanes. No. I'm alive coats. Dear life coach and help people. Have i. Really really like how it feels to help other people and see them grow. I know that i made a contribution. To their life. I like the weather has is great. Cuz i really like to do outdoor things and i like. Doing things by the ocean. Traffic and how crowded it is. Yeah. I like i live with my girlfriend and. Chili kit. We met on eharmony. I really close. Hi my meditation teacher. Yeah i used to be very shy and self-conscious and have a lot of anxiety. And i didn't you're worried a lot about the future. And i. Two classes meditation and yoga. Classes and that really helped me. Be more confident more relaxed and. Listen to my life a lot more. Meditate and do yoga. Seriously mad. I don't know about bad i don't get mad that often but frustrated i would say like being stuck in traffic. Or people that. Do mean things to other people for. No real reason. I usually if it's usually talk to somebody about it if i can. Or if i can't deny usually. Do meditation or yoga and try and. Just let it go. Pretty good at controlling my temper. With my girlfriends and it was about she was driving on the freeway. And i i suggested that she get over cuz there was some road workers on the side. Nc. Like refused to do that and stayed in the the right lane. So you are getting a bit about that. I felt like she wasn't listening to me and almost like she was purposely not doing what i suggested. To be defiant. No. Rollerblade kayak. Sing that sing in a choir. A trip i took to india and nepal for 6 weeks. Yeah. As much as i can. I really love to explore and i've loved to explore ever since i was a little kid. Anti-love. And seeing new things and discovering things about new cultures and i love. Backpacking in the wilderness. And she's exploring nature. I went on a trip to india and nepal it's my first time ever there. First week and a half i was with a big group of people and did a meditation and yoga retreat. And went white-water rafting on the ganga river. And then i went off on my own for the rest of the trip and went backpacking. In nepal with a guide there. And i was just really beautiful in the annapurna area. And then i went to back into india and explored. Very up near tibet and then i went to. Rajasthan into a tiger park in medina pradesh and it's like. Really close to tigers. I was contacted by a friend of mine and told that they were going on this this trip and i'd always wanted to go to india so. I decided to do it. Dallas there's really fun. Caring and. Send susie astic for life. Now. No. No. I'm pretty easy i don't sleep as well as. I did when i was younger but for the most part i sleep well. Once in awhile i'll wake up. You know i like. 4 in the morning or 5 in the morning when i want to sleep till 7 and not be able to get back to sleep. But i'm in general is pretty good. I feel tired and not as motivated as usual. And then sometimes want to take a nap in the afternoon. No. 10 or 20 years ago. I guess to wish i would have been vested. Money or bought like a house or something when i was younger. I would probably be there by 7 get myself. I am empathetic with other people. Positive and kind of a positive outlook on life. Very determined when i decide to do something. A figure out how to do it even if it's challenging. Very creative and. Figured out creative ways to do things. I guess probably the. Strongest thing is that i'm pretty balanced very organized but i'm also pretty creative. So how pretty balanced that way. I'm pretty close but closer than i was when i was younger. Although i said i'm probably closer to friends and people that. Are in a spiritual community with me then i'm able. Ticket to my family. Being outdoors and nature and exercising. And also singing. The fact that i've gone with followed my heart and then what i wanted to do versus. Going with what i think i should do. I guess yesterday i was i spent the day by the beach and just. Bicycle then went skating and. Visit some old friends there. I felt very relaxed and invigorated. And. I also felt like i missed living by the beach cuz i used to live really close to the beach. Sagacity. Little bit sad that i didn't live there anymore but really happy to be there. Goodbye. \n",
      "Okay. Hey. Yes. Fine how are you. Watts california but now i live in west l.a.. I love the sunshine of the palm trees i love that you're. 30 minutes away from everything. Great city. The traffic. Terrible. That study child development. Yeah actually i teach children how to be safe in a traffic situation. Shuffle dream job is to be a filmmaker that's what i want to do i would have died doing that job. Making movies. Well when i was in high school i did a lot of drama theater productions and i just love everything about film so once i had the opportunity to actually make a film. Because i wasn't getting any work as an actor i just got hooked i just love making feel. Last time i made a film just this last october made it short film. It's about three people that connect together they're completely unrelated but they get to a retreat where they realize that their problems are bigger than what they imagined. Thanks. Really bad. Really mad i. You know i guess what makes me really mad as when my daughter acts stupid at school when she does not do her work. And. Which doesn't pay attention and i have to get phone calls home and letters home and emergency parent come. That's when. Yes sucks she's one of the smartest kids in her school. No it's it's it's very difficult because a lot of things in yourself that. You find her negative. Go. To them and it's like you're fighting against yourself trying to change yourself but you know that little person is you. You know * 152 deal with that. Buttom. Other than that it's okay but it's peter. it's never easy. The hardest thing about being a parent. I would say is. Trying to give. That little person so much life experience so that they don't make. Mistakes are so that they don't get hurt and you want to give it to them and you want them to just accept it right away but then they don't so. It gets very. Annoying sometimes that you know what's coming and you give them info and they don't want to take it they want to find their own way and watch them get hurt. It's it's sad and then they want to come in your like i tried to tell you but you can't be mad at them because everybody learns their own way. Yeah i guess for wylie. When you think about it when you watch them go through their struggles it's hard to watch. But it's a necessary motion of life. Children have to learn. The way they. 1 alarm. Cuz once they get it they got it so however they get it. You as a pair of your happy they got it. All the love the children bestow upon you the great they. Yeah they let you know love you and all specially my daughter she always wants give me hugs. She always wants to talk to me she always wants to be around me. She always tells me i'm doing a great job whenever. How does she know about a great job she's only seven but. You know they have that unconditional love and you just can't help but feel like a good person for. Having. The children tell you. That you're good person. I like that. I got there. You know like albert einstein said it best that our technology has exceeded our humanity. And there's so much technology out there kids are learning so fast it's almost like they're already little adults but they're missing the steps to being a child they miss. Going outside they miss learning about things naturally rather than just going to youtube. You know wherever facebook and in getting it so fast and they don't know what to do with all this information. And they just have to fight through all that info and it's not organic anymore children growing up these days it's not organic. Sped up its push. And it's just so hard for them to figure out who they are in this were. Me cook just. Breathe in breathe out i'll just walk away from the situation. I argue with my fiance couple months ago about. Casa forgot. I forgot i don't remember. It was petty. They didn't last long. Cuz she's like me she doesn't like to argue about stuff. Like to take care of stuff. As it happens. And that's it. My fiance. Elk me we met when i was working at. Attached not a charter school but a day. Recreational center. We met there and we talked we hit it off we didn't see each other for an entire year. And then we reconnected and. We went on a date and it was great ever since. My family were pretty close my brother lives in colorado my sister lives in oklahoma i have a dad that lives in a neighboring city where i am. As close as we can be with the distance. And certain choices that my family have made over the years you know being far away. But my immediate family like. Fiance. Daughter like we're close. It's great. I don't travel enough but i have traveled a couple of times within the last 5 years i just came back from new zealand so that was a great. I enjoy meeting new people. That's the biggest thing about traveling. I like seeing new things i like. Just immerse myself in different culture. And situation. And i like. Being away from it all. That's good too. Well i went to new zealand not too long ago and i. Stayed. Therefore week. I learned about celsius cuz you know here we have fahrenheit. And that was fun i learned how to play cricket. I learned how to get myself out of a capsized kayak. And i learned that they have a lot of lamb lamb is good i like lamb but they had a lot of land. In their sufi food i can eat but they do have really great chocolate chocolate. So good. And ice cream. And other people were really really nice. They say it was a very special time for me to go there was great and they accepted me i love that and. Yeah can't wait to go back. Yes it was. Some of my best qualities. Energetic very personable of. Intelligent. I am easy to get along with i work pretty hard. And i'm very slow. To getting upset about the. No. No. Fairly easy. I guess i get pretty moody you know i could be a little little snappy at people when i don't sleep well when i have. Lack of sleep. But once i get. She's sleeping me. No no no changes now. You know he would say that i'm pretty funny lacks about a lot of things i enjoy life as much as i possibly can. I'm good friend to have around. And always ready and eager to help. Just waking up in the morning. It's always a great thing. I love ice cream that's always good. I love laughing. If somebody's laughing especially my fiance cuz he has a great laugh. Then that puts me in a good. Thank you. And that's what i want to do i definitely want to get into acting and really work it and get some really good rose. Either positive influence he stayed out of trouble. He's maintained a good working relationship with people and he's always positive and. Very super helpful and very encouraging. Oh we went to junior high school and high school together so he's my best friend. Yes it is. Wow there's so many. Had a nice bag of eminem's and we have went to a play. And there were two girls that were a couple of rows down that you know we didn't particularly care for. That's how. Kids are. They don't know how to you know what they say they don't like somebody but you know. Anyway. But we got these eminem's and wilder. It was dark we start throwing eminem's and hit them in the head with eminem's. And then we came to school like 3 days later and we were summoned and there was a mock trial. To get. So we were able to get ourselves off. All like the entire group had found us not guilty of the crime. But then we got in trouble anyway because our teacher just wouldn't allow was to not get in trouble so we had to clean up the yard for like today. Oh man you name it all of scuba diving i've only done it twice but i love it when i get back into it. Like traveling. I love. Exercising i actually like working out now i used to think it was a chore but now. I'm really really getting into it. That i love watching movies you put me in front of a good movie and i'm a happy camper. But it hanging out with family. Rat. You know what i think i probably regret. Not. Going up to will smith when i had the chance. Yeah will smith was coming up the street and i saw him and i got so nervous i jumped in the bushes in. I didn't meet him my boss of the time thought it was really funny but i just i wasn't ready to meet him yet so. But i think i regret meeting him. Advice i would give myself 10 or 20 years ago. I would probably say that when my gut told me to do something. I should have just went on ahead and did it rather than sitting analyzing you know days weeks months later. If i feel it in my gut i should go for it so go with my gut more. Really happy. Really happy i had a film festival that i was putting together. And things were so intense we things were going wrong but then things are going right but then once the people came and packed the house. I was really happy that we had a packed house. At the suffield. So this was about a month ago. Let's see i think right now at this point i'm most proud of putting a short film together with a minimal budget but it has amazing actors it has a great storyline and. I didn't think it could be done but it's done or close to being done. And i'm proud of that i was able to get it done i think i can walk away happy knowing that i gave it a really good. Shot.

You know everyone's different you know ones like the same italy. To some aspen. And i love the scenery i love you knows the mountains there beautiful. You know great for hikes you know taking out you know the dog the family hero. It's nice it's pretty active yeah. The smog i don't like the smog. Do you know if you go out further out you know you could tell by the air you know or. You know everything. Clear the skies bluer but other than that like you know in traffic nobody likes traffic i think. Yeah but. Yeah pretty much. Ellie's pretty nice you know. I like it. Well i was. Setting just basic you know i'm not sure exactly what i want to be so it's just kind of you know. Here and they're just jumping through hoops and. Not really. Set yet. Still trying to find my interest i suppose. My dream jobs. That's a good one. I love working with children. So i would say probably a child psychologist just cuz you know it's great. You know to learn what's going on the young minds. And you know how we could help children develop a better way. You know make children you know or help. Hope you know. Help them. Yeah grew up in a positive way. I suppose instead of like going the wrong track. You know help children. I depends it depends on the situation i mean sometimes you know i could be like super outgoing and just like you know. And sometimes i could just i could be all quiet or whatnot and just paying attention you know if i'm like in class or whatever. I don't really like in these everyone talkin i just i prefer just to stay away from that you know cuz i need something else to concentrate on something else you know there's like a moment in time for everything i supposed. Yeah. I like to kick my feet up in the couch and like read a good book you know just. Get my mind going to another you know. Galaxy or universe or. Situation you know it's pretty fun you know just. You know reading and then just having. Yourself relax. Feeling good. Yeah it is it is fun i love reading. I'm okay with it i'm not like the best you know that a controlling person there is out there. You know i try my best and i guess it's all i could do until i keep. Doing better eventually. I'm not like the best i mean i sometimes i do have my outburst you know. And i guess that's everyone. I'm not sure if you know. Haha. That's a good question. I don't remember lipsey. Honestly i can't recall maybe. My goodness. I don't know it's very passive that. just like let things go cuz i mean what's the point of making a big deal out of things. It also. Huh i don't know i'm not i i can't i honestly i can't tell you that. Sure. Yeah probably. Come back to me. Ha. Well i guess. When i was younger i dunno could have been better older sister and i wasn't. And that makes me feel guilt. You know i could have been a better sister. Better role model you know but i'm trying my best now so i'm trying to make things better. Yeah. I guess. I don't know. I mean. I'm the person i am because of the events that have happened in my life so if i erase something then. There's something of me and my present self or. You know they would change end. I don't know i'm pretty okay with. The person that i am now i mean. You know i don't think i would change an event. You know i'm i'm okay with. What. You know. Bumps and downs and get them bad that has happened. Yeah. I can't see your shoes but i don't travel a lot. But i am kind of like an explorer i guess i love to explore like. Even the smallest things like if i go hiking i go off trail and. You know just. Find my way up to the top. You know somehow some way and just make it. You know traveling. I would love to do that but. I don't know what just you know. Always circumstances in my life that. Then you know always something you know i'm getting. Mary children you do and all this. So it's kind of like you know. It would be nice i guess you know. It would be nice. You know i love camping that's kind of like funerals taking a few days trips out there campion. Fishing yeah. It was the summer you know me and my husband went camping and. It was really nice was just me and him you know and there was no one and it was like beautiful cuz it was just in the middle of the woods with a beautiful lady again. You know it was it was really nice. Hey just. Yeah. Hell. Yeah it was it was it was really fun it was like i would love to do it again. You know right now. It would be great you know it's just going out there is this. I love that venture of things in the nature and just life and. You know hover all. It's it's easy but lately i haven't been able to sleep like at night right away because. I don't know just you know just i'm laying there and i'm just like trying to go to sleep and i'm just like. Probably like me to position myself in a different side of the bed like sometimes i'm i'm in the headboard and i'm like i got to go to the other side and once i positioned myself and i just like go to sleep you know. But it's just i got to find the the right position for me. Yeah. I'm tired i get tired. The throughout the day you know but i kind of try to shake it off you know and just kind of like. Feel like it's a new day you know and just try to make the day. That i have. Greatest possible. You know and then try to like make it up by sleeping at night too. So yeah yeah yeah. It's okay i try to make it. The best i guess. If not then i just go to sleep throughout the day which. I know. No. I've been good yeah i've been feeling really good. You know a lot of things in my life have you know it's having a really good year so far so i'm very. Happy with that you know everything. You know going good you know. Yeah it is it is except that i just got out of a cold and it was horrible but. That's just nature. Super happy was. When the doctor told me i was pregnant you know i was. Really really happy about that and i was just calling you know that was really really good you know. Very excited and just reading about what's going on with my body and what's going on with the baby and. Who's it's very overwhelming and scary i've never really liked. No. I guess just me myself and i would like. Yeah well i could. You know just be myself and. That's it you know just i can't really. You know say i have specific thing i guess i was mean it depends on the person that meets me. To tell me i can't really tell myself like oh i'm this i'm that you know just try to be my best and try to portray something good for other people.. You know tell me where if you compliment me or whatnot. Yeah. Nothing i think. Like i said i'm happy with the person i am right now. And you know. My flaws or whatever you know i might have i don't know whatever flower people seeing me and it's okay you know i'm okay with it. Whatever it just. I'm not going to. They can't change myself for. The likings of other people in one life so. Yeah that's it. Just my childhood with my sisters and my family but. You know. You know how you learned from that. You know from the past and you kind of feel like. Hey you know maybe i should be a better role model you know. For my children and so my children could be better role model so the world could just improve. Just smile and be happy. You know and whatever hard things happened you know you're going to get through him eventually you know the only thing you can tell. I don't know you can. You know. Go back on his desk you know you could you know the heartbreak or whatever but. Nails long as i'm alive. I still got to keep going. I don't know. That's pretty. Most proud of. I guess that i'm trying my best to be the best i could be. And that's pretty powerful you know i i'm. You know i try to be. You know. A better person each day and try to like. You know i'm prove myself everyday as much as i can. You know that would probably be something i could be super proud of you know. As much as i can. Very hard it is really hard you know cuz i can't say you know it's easy to be bad but it's hard to be good you know. You know it's always challenges and everything that goes you know in your life. You know it's just it's it's sometimes. You know hard you know and sometimes it comes easy you know after awhile you get a lot of practice and everything's just like you have a great day and you can even. Try you know. So yeah. You know. Loving friendly outgoing you know adventures i guess i don't know that's what they say. You know but that's what least what i try to be. You know at least i try to. Give the best foot forward always. As much as possible you know even sometimes even if i'm having a rough day i'm just like you know. You know i just don't want to take it out on anyone or anything you know. My ideal weekend. You shouldn't i i like going to the park. I like sitting down in like a tree under a tree. Under-achiever there's shade and just kind of like. Put my blanket out there have my dog in. Like read a book and you sometimes. If i don't have my dog like there's little squirrels running around and they like me to feed them so that's pretty neat you know. Just sitting there and just enjoying the air and the. Noise i guess cuz there's not silence. You know the wind and the cars and. You know it just it's really. Sneak. Yeah. Thank you you're welcome. \n",
      "Okay. Alright great thank you. Yes that's fine. I'm okay. How are you. Originally i'm from san francisco. Originally i moved here in gosh 19 95. Then i went to chicago. Then to san francisco and then back to los angeles probably about 5 years ago. A lot of moving. Never. There just isn't anything there for me anymore. The weather is better in la. But the people in san francisco or nicer. My husband prefer my ex-husband prefers it here that's why we moved. I have an undergraduate degree in psychology and after that i went to law school. When i was in college i worked at a law firm. And decided that i really wanted to be a lawyer it was really interesting. No now i'm a stay-at-home mom. No. I love it but it is it is. Difficult you have to manage a life to make sure that they. Become. A good. And successful person. It's easy to kind of do the academics and stuff like that you know i'm good at that the hardest thing i think is to guide them. Emotionally. To help him through things that he's having. A hard time with. Feeling like i don't have all the answers. I'm just seeing them grow and and experience new things and. Learn about life in the world it's just it's really really cool. What are some ways that. Completely different. Completely different and i am not a perfect parent but i love my son i take care of him. He's. The first priority in my life. And they weren't like that at all. Tell me about your relations. Well my parents are dead. I didn't speak to my dad at all before he died. I have a sister and a brother that actually i don't know where they are i don't speak to them either. Probably more shy because i consider myself more reserved. I know it's not hawaii. I like to listen to music. I have. I listen to all sorts of music but my favorite when i'm relaxing is that 80s music. Cheesy cheesy but true. It depends on who i'm with if i'm with my son. I can control my temper. If i'm with. My ex-husband or other adults yeah i don't. So-so. Yesterday. And it was about my ex-husband dating the woman that he was cheating on when we were married. I found out he was cheating on me and i kicked him out. And he told me yesterday that he's continuing to date her. Yeah. Really angry. And just really hurt. I wish that i had. Talk to my dad before he died i wish that i'd settled our differences before he had died. The hardest decision i've ever had to make was actually. Ending my marriage. Because he was cheating on me. That would have to be. Well i don't know i mean i don't know if i'd want to erase anything from my memory because it makes me. Who i am today. But i can't really think of one event that i would want to erase. I don't get a good night sleep it's not easy. I wake up a lot in the night. I don't know i wish i knew. If i knew i could change it. I could try to do something about it but i i just don't i don't know. Grumpy irritable. Grumpy irritable. Down. Mixed with. Anger. Ats. Just because of everything that i'm going through with my. Soon-to-be-ex-husband. Yeah there's. I just keep it inside. M nothing else to really do except i mean it is what it is so. I have to. Deal with it. No. Yes. 10 years ago after my son was born. 9 years ago. I felt like. I couldn't cope with. Life. I was so. Down i couldn't i felt like i couldn't do anything. No. I don't go to therapy i go to medication management. But i don't do talk therapy. I have gone. To therapist and no they don't help. Well some just sit and stare at you and don't say anything. You know if i wanted to talk to myself i would. Others give advice that i think is just. It just not not good and not on point. It was probably this morning i was playing with my son. Just really happy i wasn't thinking about. Any of the other crap. In my life i could just forget it so i was feeling really really happy. I think they would describe me completely different from the way. I would describe me but. I think they would describe me as really sweet. Cuz they have really sweet. Confident. Outgoing. Because that's what i try to be two people so i think that's how they would describe me. What are some things he wishes. I wish i wasn't sad i wish. I was more confident. Yeah there are a lot of things. I think. It would be. To not. Not. Give my life over. To one particular person which is what i did with my husband. I think i would spend my ideal weekend in a sunny place like palm springs with my son. Hanging around the pool. Having fun going out to dinner. One of my two of my friends to really good girlfriends i think have been really positive influences in my life. Her life is worse than mine and but we can always commiserate together. Is just really positive me she's always happy always up always look into the bright side so that has helped me alot. My son. I went over to a friend's house and we had movie night we watched grown up movie and had dinner and wine. And the boys were in another room watching movies and playing video games and it was just. A relaxed fun evening. Turn. My. Okay. \n",
      "Okay. Thank you. Yes i am. I'm okay. Where are you from. Chicago. Back and forth over the years and traveled a little bit. Haven't been out there over 15 16 years. Kind of. Got stuck out here then i have my baby and i just ate. Different food. The people will get along way get it it's kind of a culture shock. Can you tell me about that. Out there just on the food bases they like to give you a lot of food that tastes real good for a little bit of money to keep a lifelong customer but out here they want to go up there and give you a little bit of food for a whole lot of money so they just make it mike. Parenthood business out here. My heart. Got to get used to anymore. The views in the ocean. Distance. Splitting of people that's it. A few places. Getting to see different people on learn how different people get along and. Interact with each other. I remember years ago where i went to mexico with my brother. Yeah. Jumping into lake pretty much off the side of a mountain. Yeah. Everything. It's not a subject i don't like. Actually my dream job. Working with computers and helping people. That's. Where my heart is i like computers and also like helping people. What i'm feeling 10. What are you doing. I meditate workout. I'll run i walk. Alright read. Intermediate. I'd say very good. Oh yeah that doesn't make it seem that good last time i argued. Was. Over someone actually spitting out a racial slur. Towards my wife. Angry. Upset her. Disrespected. And especially when i went up there that treat the person actually i was treated with dignity and respect and trying to help the person a first. No problem people are people. Out-of-town since quarter really go a lot further than i did. And i let something very small. I'm meaningless stop me in a suit of it. Ignorance for lack of a better word. Now that i think back on it i could have done a whole lot to avoid it but. I was just young and foolish. Start loving again. Much pain as i've seen in the world. A compilation of all the events are just different bad things i've seen. If i could change it i would but. Sometimes. I guess things are there for a reason. Even though we may not understand it. I've no answer to that. Tell me about your relationship. Blood family really don't talk. My wife. Don't know if she really wants to be there with me or not she thinks that i'm doing everything in the world but that i'm not. I really. I don't understand. I know my daughter loves me but i don't know if she wants to be with me or not. Because. When somebody talks to you. When i say something a certain amount of times in the tonnage in a voice and a belief in their eyes. If you say something so many times it would really lies in your heart. So you can say whatever through your mouth but it's what really is there. I love my daughter. She's angel i'll cut her umbilical cord. I went out there and put on her first shirt. I seen her come out. She looked at me right out the stomach. She wouldn't she was fighting with the doctors wouldn't let him touch her a bit. I talked to her i told her to calm down i told her it was daddy she looked up at me grab my fingers and like. Just calm down and just let him do everything they needed to do. Nose constantly changing task. What you have to do on this day won't be the same thing as the next or the next after that it's constantly. What is a better word for. Adjusting. The hardest thing i'll probably say. Is. Scolding your child because you know you're doing it out of love for a notch. Learn the wrong lessons. Senior baby smile in appreciation. What are some ways that you. I try to guard my baby a lot more from things that she says. When i was younger there were a lot of things that i seen that no child or adults should have seen. And. My. I grew up. I swore to myself that always take care of my child and. I wouldn't disappear. Let her be around things like that. My foster parents. They basically showed me no matter where you come from you can always strive to get better. A good night sleep. Accounts. I like when you. The same just tired and yawning. How i've been feeling. Ike. I have a wealth of queries and. About the goal. Within my. Grass and it's just right out of my route because i just need that one. Connector to really just. See what i'm capable of and i know i'm paperwork off a lot it's just. I need to make that connection. No. Not pts ino. Said yes but. I don't figure out many more depressed or anything than any other person everyone has their different breaking point. My daughter's birthday on the 26th. Can you tell me if. Took her out to chuck-e-cheese she have fun she played games she was on bikes she was crawling through puzzle games. Man sprawled. About everything. Find loyal. Caring. What are some things you wear. I'm just change. I would like to be more accurate. Now getting to know who my mom wants. Stop thinking about whatever else happened to just do what you need to do. I'm positive from goal-oriented. Determine. I'm very imaginative very creative. Find your ideal. Ideal probably. Be doing a little bit of everything. Rock climbing biking. Hiking going with my daughter places. Man. I'll probably be skiing snowboarding and everything and ideal weekend. My daughter. No problem. Goodbye. \n",
      "Get out my ass shadow. Okay. Yes. Okay. Doing pretty good thank you. Where you from. Maryland. Yes. 85. Yeah it is long time. I don't i'm not as often as i like. Out of work so you know the money issue. Yeah. Maryland. Is different. It in so the comparison is. The only comparison is that they're both cities. But. Maryland has its flavor in la has its own flavor so they have unique you know characteristics about themselves. I moved to la because i was living in hawaii. And i was out of money. And i just had enough for a plane ticket. I'm coming stay. Here in a hotel until i found a job which i did really quickly anyway so that's why i came here i didn't want to go home. I decided to come here and. Just start over. I am i am. It was. Really easy just did it. I like i like l.a.'s weather. I like the different areas in los angeles county. West la east la. I like southern california you know. so. You know like the people but. Yes i like them. The. Attitude you know the la attitude so yeah. I don't like. I don't like some of the policies with regard to. The smoking you know i really wish that the. Government would crack down on smoking on the street. Make it like usc yeah. I'm sure you can. No not outside of. Getting on the bus and things like that. I was studying to be a nurse. Yeah. I wanted to have a job that pays well. But afforded me. The opportunity to use my service gift. So yeah. No i had to put that. Put that on the side and. I want to get a business degree now. Yeah. My dream job is. Is 2. Create new technology. Other than to say i would like to create something that. Which changed the world like steve jobs with his iphone. Yeah. I am it depends on the situation but i'm more outgoing. I do. Pentwater little shyness from time to time. What are you doing. What i do is i'll go to the movies. I went to the movies probably like maybe 5 weeks ago. Yeah. Well i had an argument recently not really argument but a disagreement. With woman at my church who. Is over. This particular department that i'm in. And it's a volunteer position. I use my administrative assistant more executive assistant skills. 2. To i do minutes. For meetings that i cover. And until then i have to produce the minutes and send them to everybody and things like that. And this person. Is micromanaging me but not micromanaging the other admin assistant who. Did not get her block of people into this particular meeting. So the meeting should have been comprised of 100 people but we have like maybe. 30 no wasn't in 3020. Yes so now she doesn't know that i realized you know that part of it. So. There was a little bit of a argument and but again not an argument but a disagreement. And when we talk again i will. Point out to the person that's over both of us that there is a disconnect. And the energy she's investing. In me is unprofitable. For what we're trying to achieve. Thumbnet.net sound good. Yeah. Well a little attacked. You know. So. It depends on i'm very good at controlling my temper. It's so you know there are places where you can. Allow your temper to come out. Even though it might not be appropriate and then there are other places where if it comes out then you shot yourself in the foot. So i'm pretty good at controlling my temper. Yeah. I don't have any situation. Recent that i can think of. Probably say. Just dealing with a neighbor instead of. Responding to the neighbor just ignore the neighbor altogether so i wish i'd done that differently. Yeah. Thankfully. I've not had to make that type of decision. In my life as yet. I have. What i do in my life and then you know in my. Going forward you know. Everything that. I've done and everything that has happened. I. Accept it as something that. Have to be. To get me to go for it. I am a born-again christian and so i know that. That god is sovereign over my life. And also that according to his word. The bible says that every day of our life is written in his book. So events and circumstances. I feel that i feel they are ordained by god not obviously i'm not going to. Jumping to a. Burning fire or do anything ridiculous. But. I feel that things that have that have happened. Even if i've dealt with them the wrong way. It's god's. The his. Total sovereignty has control over that and it will work for my good. So that's how i feel. I have all brothers. And so i'm not really that close. With my brother. And my mother. Say that again. People that have grown up with neighbors from when i. I when i was younger. But i was close to. Different friends. That i've had along the way friends who. Are more like family so yeah. They've had positive. How is he. That's i get i sleep too well. So i sleep well every night. Normal. But i my normal i've been feeling my normal. No. No. No. That was real. Something happened. I was able to participate. With my church on sunday but i was a pentecost. It was pentecost sunday meeting it was 50 days after the resurrection of jesus christ. And so i was able to participate in our prayer. Session that we had at my church and i thought that was really. Maybe very happy. That i'm smart they would say that i'm smart. That. That i handle difficulties very well. And then i dress well. I don't want to change anything. I do want to just be a better me. So be a better person. Iso. I am. Working on. Listening better. Communicating better. And and i accepting my. Weaknesses better as well as my strength. No. That's a good question. I would have. I would have told myself to. To do what i know to do to do what i know that which is right and to do what i know is right and let everything else let. The other chips fall where they may. But to do what i know to do is right. And the go forward. I am very proud of the fact that. I don't give up. Bye and thank you. Thank you. \n",
      "Okay. Yes. I'm doing fine. I was born in texas and i moved to california when i was three and grew up here in california. I was yes. I've never been back there. Don't have any relatives there. Don't have a reason to go back there. Well might my family's here. That's one of the weather's great. The beaches and mountains are here. All those things are very good. The traffic. Probably most people say. Expensive to live here. Who's by the talk to you. Recently i've traveled. Well you get to see new places in a new people. You get to learn more about other cultures. And i different ways people think. At the end of march i went to ecuador for a week. I spent most of. Most of one day with. With an ecuadorian who only speak spanish and i speak very little spanish so we got. It was it was challenging for me trying to communicate with him. Celica a little kid. Trying to. You say you know what's this what's this. I was very humbling. You're just just seeing that. Hey when you don't we're not able to communicate that that can be very difficult. I'm probably more of a shy person. Genetics i don't know why. I'm an electrician so i studied. Electrical construction. I've also say the computer networking. It was. I guess. Just kind of circumstances. I needed. The. Didn't work i was doing wasn't providing for the family. And. I knew someone who. Could get me a job doing electrical work and so so i pursue that because of. The financial gain. It's giving me a lot of opportunity. But i don't think it's only what i want to do for the rest of my life. Well i'm actually pursuing becoming a missionary my wife and i are looking at moving down to ecuador in the fall. After 4 years. And last year we we trained in north carolina. For one year. And that was like theology and bible training. Basically god put. Hey a desire in my heart. To get beyond. Get beyond myself and and do something for other people to to go in. And learn about another people their culture. And to share the gospel with them. All my immediate family. I'm i'm married of a married for 10 years this june and we have four daughters. And then. But i have one older brother. How no sisters. To what what do you want to know about my family. I'm really close with my wife and my daughters. I was my brother i'm not not real close partly because he's at he's mentally handicapped. I'm he has the mental capacity of a 7 year old. Even though he's five years older than me. So just kind of because of that dynamic it's hard to have a close relationship with him. I am pretty close with my parents my brother lives with my parents. I'd save my i use fashion high school. He was a real real positive influence and me. Just he has a. Kaiser drive is heel for. For pursuing the truth. And just. Studying the bible in. And because of his influence that kind of. Put me on a path to wanting to study the bible. I think i've gotten better at it. There have been times when. We all get angry and. Yo it can just. Had a really rule over me just a frustration. And i'm the type of person that takes me. I'm usually it takes some time for me to get angry and then sometime too. To calm down again. But i've. I've learned. Overtime that really getting angry. And keeping that anger in dozen. It doesn't. Attack the other person or the thing that i'm angry at it just kind of attacks me. It's a really it's not a it's not a good behavior to. To keep so. Went went things anger me i tried to. I talk to the person say. Held at the situation is making me upset try to kind of talk through it. And in resolving come to resolution. Even more than just compromising but trying to really resolve the root of the problem. Well. A couple weeks ago her maid as maybe you in a month ago. My wife and i were going on a trip with with her parents. And her parents had already left. It we're just driving down to. Orange county area for this trip. And. My wife wanted what she had said expectation of certain things to be done before the trip or certain things we packed. And. But hadn't really in my eyes had expressed that clearly but her eyes she had. And so. When i was trying to meet those expectations. She. I didn't meet him according to to what she wanted and then she became angry and so from my perspective i was doing what she wanted. And kind of getting attacked for it. So today i started yelling at her. And. And we know we have that conflict but then. Yeah we're within an hour so we kind of talked through. And we had figured out what the the cause of that conflict was. Are you asking the moment of during the conflict. Very ill just very angry you know you can feel it. And your body part parlay. D'agostino. Anguirus play the secondary response but my initial response was that if it was feeling attacked. And i came out as anger. So. I would think yes or initial i felt attacked and then that resulted in the anchor. I guess it was. Deciding to go. Hometogo charge training last year. I felt the guy to put on my heart.. That this was something i supposed to pursue. My wife didn't feel that way. And. I just felt very strongly that that was something that we should pursue. But at the same time i knew that if if my wife wasn't supportive of it that it would kind of fall apart. So. I kind of relinquished it. I said her know i'm not going to make you go. Real life if you want to go then then we'll go but if not then we'll we'll do something else we'll look at at doing something else and not going. So that that was difficult for me because. You again that i kind of felt like a loss cuz i felt deeply that that's what i was supposed to do. But then after i kind of gave that up. Then. Did she came to a point where said no i have a piece about. doing this and we went ahead and pursuit at so. They're just kind of giving it up what was it was difficult for me. Tell you about something bad or something that you can erase my memory. I miss you. Not sure. There no i am i can't really. Think of anything very traumatic. Thought i would win a race. I think. You're good things and positive good things and bad things they all kind of. Shape who we are. And. So i i can't think of anything that would want to erase. Usually. Usually it's not too bad. Are you referring to on the the questionnaire when i said that i had some trouble sleeping. That the job i work for. Beyond. Cuz that the scheduling is shifted so i. So lately i've been working some night time shifts. Are graveyard shifts. So. Coming home in the morning y'all when it's light then it's been hard for me to sleep. But it was mostly cuz i was staying up so late because of work. Pretty easy. What i do when i don't sleep that i do get cranky. I have been feeling good lately. No not really. No. No. Her--no. Can't think of anything that was. Kind of the ordinary. But. Yesterday. We my wife and i took. Tegar zr3 younger girls we took him to the park the oldest one. Stay with her grandma. But we we took them to the park and they played. And. Yeah so that those are always happy times we take the kids to the park. I think you say i'm a. A family man. That. I'm a dependable that you can you can count on me. Usually my friend i end up doing. To do work around the house for him. Cuz i'm kind of a handyman so. So that way i think you say i'm kind of dependable or someone who can go to for advice. I guess i would. I guess i would like to be able to. Start conversations with people. Easier. Sometimes. I have trouble. Just talking to people. Especially if they're in a group but if people are one-on-one then it's it's usually easier for me to talk to them. But kind of talking to people in a group. How i wish i was a little better at that. Tell if it's. Okay. What was it say right before that was that. If if i'm giving a speech or something to a large group i don't really have a problem with that but if it's. More interaction type thing that's kind of. Advise hooligan to myself tear 20 years ago. Probably would have been too to go to college right away instead of. Going to school later in life. What about it. That would have been the biggest difference. My life i think. What. Have four kids and. I hope i'm raising him right i hope that. That. You're the mistakes that i've made i can kind of guide them. Through their their journey in life and i hope that they. And up a little. Better for it then. 10 mi. Yeah i just hope. Hope kind of susan. That i can. Heal. Believe something worthwhile. You're welcome. Goodbye. Torrid. Okay. \n",
      "Josiah. I'm doing very good today. I'm originally from chicago illinois. Modiano three. Yes. Americo back. Family issues. It depends. On what you're into. If you're into. The fast life and hollywood it doesn't compare at all. If you're into. The cold weather than you would rather be out there i like the sun. My mom and my dad split up. It's okay. I have no idea i was only three when i moved out here. I like the sunshine. I like the weather i like the balance of the weather we have in the spring winter. Fall and end in the summer. I like the beaches. I like hollywood. I like that the lakers are here. And. I love the people is is a different variety i think. La is a microcosm of the united states. People from all over the world come to the united states and people from all over the country and all over the world they come to la for a better opportunity so. That's what i like about l.a.. Oh gang violence. No not really i've travel one time to arizona and one time the stockton california. And another time to barstow california but i don't do much traveling right now. Mainly because of finances. I study alcohol and drug counseling. I just filled it in my i just felt in my heart that that's who i was supposed to be doing with my life is helping people overcome their addiction. So. Kind of easy choice i got some advice from people and. I just went into it. To do it just just to see what it was. And. Finish school in. Did internship and got hired. And. So. I believe that's what i'm supposed to be doing with my life. I'm not working right now i actually moved. Away and. I had to. I was married and we had to move away we moved away because rent was cheaper so i actually had to give up that job. Dinner to make that move. But since i came back down i've been sending out applications and sending resume. And trying to get interview so i can get back into counseling. Well. It can be. It can be very difficult at times because. I have a felony. And and so i can't work with you and i can work with the elderly. And but the regular adults i can. And then you have to be certified and i'm not certified yet you have to work a certain amount of hours in order to be certified before they even lie you to take the test you after work a certain amount of hours. So right now i'm just trying to get into. Interns you know try to intern and show people what i can do as a counselor because everything about me is not seen them my resume. And. Yeah they just want people to be certified not being certified. The experience. And the fact i have a felony makes it hard. And my dream job is to open my own facility. Or as an author. You know that the. That depends on on. On people mainly i mainly. Adapt my personality to the people that i'm around if people are perky that i'm going to be perky if they're standoffish then i may seem shy but i'm not sure i'm just giving them their space and allowing them to decide when they want to open up. But. If people open up right away then i open up right away. I'm in listen to music or. I watch youtube. Write poetry. I'll just close my eyes and just lay down and pretend like i can sing. Which i can't. So that. And nothing i do is. I eat ice cream. Controlling my temper i'm very very good at it it depends on what it is i have to say that. Last time i lost my temper because i felt like. Somebody with. Scaring my mother so i lost my temper but. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred. I don't lose my temper. Don't like to raise my voice and. I just like to be calm and cool and i like everybody be comfortable i don't want anybody to be frightened or anything there's no reason for anybody to be frightening for us to. Be angry and. You know taking out i'll pass frustrations out on people who had nothing to do with it. I just believe that. And i believe. Angry outbursts to be a link to. Heart problems and high blood pressure so i definitely don't want that. Well i was just telling you about. It was it was my mother's husband and. Tell you the truth. I could have handled that differently. But when i seen the look in my mama's eyes of fear i just lost it. And i snapped. You know i told my mother like i don't like this. Yeah i need you to take care of this because. I'm don't know how long i can keep my composure. As far as this cuz i've been seeing this guy mistreat my mother mistreat my mother but that's her husband and so i kept my distance in a relationship but when i saw her having fear in her eyes. That triggered a part of me. Dad. I don't like very much. Because i know if i get angry i usually stay angry for a long time so. I should have just left. I should have just left and went home and rested and got up the next morning with the church but. Yeah yeah we had a big time explosion and egg crate and that created a lot of damage for about 6. Deny months. So. Yeah those 69 must i can't get back. Yes. Well my brother in prison. I haven't seen him in twenty years he's been there 20 years my sister move to chicago. 13 years ago i haven't seen her since then so i'm only close to my mother. And. My son i haven't seen him in 5 years and i'm still looking for him and waiting for the day i see him again and. How that's going to turn out for me i just. You know i have small family and. I have family in chicago but. I don't. Mess around with. That side of the family. Just because. Of what i seen. And hurt so i just don't want it to happen to me at all. So i just keep my distance. Someone's been a positive it is. Influence in my life i would say. Taught me how to get my temper under control and how to express my emotions without. Me expressing my emotions being threatening to someone else. And. Taught me how. How to like monitor my emotions in monitor my thoughts and how strong my thoughts are and when they're really strong that's when i just need to be quiet until. That intense fizzling subsides and then i can speak rationally. And not just emotionally. And of course he's. He was the one that in. Told me that i should look into being a drug and alcohol counselor he got. 27 years clean and sober right now he used to live on scary road and the way he changed his life around and you know the way he approached me as a father was just. Something that i'll never forget. Feel guilty about. My grandfather. Password 2004. And. At that time i was just getting out of prison. 2002 hours just getting out of prison. And he came to see me. And he. Told me in so many words that he wasn't going to be around for that much longer. But i didn't get it cuz i had a lot of drugs and alcohol in my life at the time and. My life is crowded with things that i consider to be more important than that. Plus the fact i didn't understand him. What he was saying. But. When he died. I figured out that he was telling me. That should probably spend more time with him before it's time for him to go but i couldn't see it then. And. I feel. I think about it all the time. Erase from my memory. Will be the date. My brother hit my mom i always replay that over and over and over and over in my mind. And it's like. That's what memories i can just go without. Replaying my mind over and over and over and over and over again. So. Yeah that dick that memory right there. I feel conflicting feelings. Because i want hand. On way hey my brother was protecting me. From getting beat. And on the other hand he was hitting my mom. So. Time in the middle. Most nights i don't. I go to sleep maybe 3 in the morning. And i'm proud i'm more than likely up at 7 in the morning. So i don't get much sleep. It depends. It depends on the environment on man. If i don't sleep well. I'm going eventually i'm going to be here tuebl. But doesn't happen right away it depends on my environment and who's around me if they're difficult people that's going to be a challenge for me. And. If people are easy going no one would even know that i didn't get much sleep. I've been feeling lately. I just been feeling like. Dad. Things are about to start going better for me. Making some better decisions. Taking advantage of the opportunities that come to me taking advantage of my talents taking advantage of meeting the right people that can open the right doors for me so i'm very enthusiastic about that even if it doesn't happen i'll send out a million resumes. I don't care if i get. Five interviews i've never stopped because i know. Know that been a counselor is my life mission and and i'm also destined to be a writer and it's just a matter of time before my book is out there and people. Know about me because i found a lot of time to study human behavior and things like that and have a lot to offer humanity so it's just a matter of time before. That the public is exposed to what. I've been gathering. My behavior i'm more mellow. I laughed more more humorous. A lot of things go that i used to just. Let tick me off. And anger me. And things that i can't control like trying to control people or. Or trying to make sure people don't betray me and. You just can't control that i think i'm mature mentally. It's like a logically. And the. Acquisition of a sense of humor was a major. Major breakthrough for me. So. I know my thoughts of change and with my thoughts changing my behavior has changed i said i have to monitor it. My thoughts and my behavior at the album to monitor them but overall i. You know. Back then i just tolerated myself. Now i. Actually like myself. And it will boohoo you. To feel the same way. No no i haven't. No. Last time i felt happy was last night cuz the lakers won the basketball game. My best friend was described me he calls me the truth. Because i always tell the truth and people try to hide stuff and i always refill it. They can't hide it from me i have a statement that says i see through you like a clear glass with nothing in it. And i see stuff days and months before they start happening. I know human behavior when i see it. And i sniff it out real well and it's just a gift that was given to me so he calls me the truth because of how i interact with people and how people. Have to come clean with me because when they look at me they know that i see through them. Like i said like a clear glass with nothing in it and. Yes that's why you called me the truth. I wish i would have never. Well obviously i wish i would have never went to prison. I wish. Dokken change. Well. My economic status my employment status. My teeth that's like a problem area for me i did a lot of stupid things years ago and it caught up with me and i didn't take care of my teeth and now that i need to be. Confident. About myself as i can be you know. It always comes up. Baby now and then you know the thought like i wonder if they look at my teeth i want them to look at my teeth i never get the i never get the impression that they are but in the back of my mind there she starts that says. Are they looking at my teeth so i will really. Change that and i will change. My physical. Size i think i would. Like to be. At least 35 pounds heavier. But i'm working on it. 20 years ago which would make me 18. I would have at that time i was a big-time high school basketball player for fremont high school and i had colleges coming to see me and i would have given myself the opportunity. Was to stay away from the troublemakers. Because i didn't and i blew my opportunity to play college basketball for duke blue devils and who knows. Could have been playing for the lakers last night but hey. I'm most proud of the fact that. You know what i'm most proud of my mom. Really. Really. She graduated from school. She had a full-time job she got a full-time job. She would wake up at. 5 in the morning. Go to work. Get off her job at 3:30 go straight to the college lead the college at 9 at night. She does this 5 days a week. And still had the strength to maintain she was on the dean's list and the president's list. So doing all of this. You know when they say. That older people can do things i just think that's dispels that rumor. And she recently got her license as a evangelist in the church. So. I'm just real proud of that and. Her life is been affecting people. And in a positive way so yeah mama. Okay thank you. Goodbye. Okay so did you know that she stopped. Oh okay okay. \n",
      "Can't you see me right now. Hello. Yeah. I am. Good to moderate. Los angeles. Yeah i'm from. Just a lot different kinds of people and. I love the weather most of the time and great creative seeing and i'm really into music so. It's a great scene for that. I don't like driving i don't know who does right. It's just it's just such a dragon 2. Getting from point a to point b is just a daily need and it doesn't get any easier. Too many people. Too many people. Can't see your shoes. Yeah when i can. I want when i can afford to. Staying somewhere else not having to drive usually must places of. Better public transportation. Just a culture junkie i like experiencing different types of cultures so. So yeah. How many places i've been to like mexico and italy. It-it's. Yeah we're going to more places only go to japan. So that'll be interesting at usually this is my family. My mom sometimes my girlfriend sometimes my brother and we just. Yeah we go to italy we spent two weeks there was cool. Living next to the best gelato shop in italy. We weren't we were in florence spent a spend a week in florence. That was great. Big biggie. culture as well. Studied film and digital media. Cuz i make music and i want to learn how to make music videos. So don't try and get into. Yeah. Yeah i mean. I need to get a camera that's the thing. But my main focus is music i studied film but my focus is music. Sure i've been playing music and playing guitar keyboard bass drums. For about 12 years now and i do production and songwriting an indie rock band. That's a great website highly recommended and it's it's mine so. Shake it up. International rockstar music producer and. Filmmaker. Director. Probably outgoing. I'm just. Feel like it's a way to get the most out of life. Talking to people and learning about them and having them learn about you and care about you it's a. Counts kustom territory. Yeah. Do meditation. And. It's not really hard cuz it's fun. It relaxes me and helps me focus the same time. Which yeah that that was a huge epiphany for me that you can relax and focus at the same time cuz normally when i'm relaxing and i'm tuning out. I'm focusing on something else but. To be able to combine those sensations was yeah i've been doing that for about. At 3 months now so. Yeah. It is. Almost to get a time sometimes there's things that should be sad. That ipod i don't. Because. You know it's like you're opening up a can of worms maybe one of your friends for example i got a problem with him but they don't have a problem with him necessarily so you can do anything to them. And i've had to deal with that in the past sort of a. Awkward social situation but. Yeah. I make deal. Probably argued with the guitarist for my band. We are falling out we're not going to be in a band together and we're still friends so. At least is that. Butter. Live is just basically about. Creative control the project and how we're going to prioritize it and in our lives and. No we just our priorities weren't the same and i got very upset so. That was the end of that. I felt. Good that it was definitive that it was no choice has been made on both parties. Also regretful that you know he didn't. Feel the way that i wanted him to feel about it which was excited about the project so. Zach that he wasn't really in. Hey kind of piss me off. But. I got over it. Any i got some other people that are really really excited to be working with me or even honored. So. You know. I'm my keep gone. Thank you. I don't know. I don't really i don't really have any regrets like that. At the moment i can't really think of any. When i was in high school cheated on my girlfriend. I don't think it would mean anything. Time. But i did it. I regret it. But i'm. You know. Yeah life happens. You make some mistakes. Selfishness. Being young and thinking it would matter. You know. Thinking. You know you only live once and. You know for me it's probably for the best ultimately cuz you know i love my current girlfriend and i would never do that to her so. That was years ago but. She was a nice girl she didn't deserve that. I got it. Jism. I guess whether to go to college or not cuz i had some projects going in l.a. that i didn't really want to. Shut off a tab and going get a manager we were playing out a lot and i wasn't sure if i wanted to keep that going or go to school and start over. And. I made the decision to go to school in santa cruz and and start a new life there for 4 years and. It was a difficult decision but. I'm glad i did send that a lot of people a lot of people i'm still close with today that. And we work on stuff together and all that so. I agree. That's good thank you. Maybe i wish i could forget. Getting. Spanked in the parking lot when i was four by danish babysitter. You know. I need descale it's pretty low but it was somewhat humiliating and i i don't forget so. I'm pretty the other picture of it and. I'd be happier if it wasn't there. Positive. They're a sportive on the give me a hard time sometimes because. They. Don't think that. I keep things in perspective and terms of how many spore myself even though i do it's just dumb. You know i have a. A more long-range picture than they do and i have faith in myself and. The creative projects that i make so. Yeah. There's a bit of tension there. Just cuz. Young dicks back certain things from me and i expect them as well but. I just have a different way of going about it then they might. Prefer. But they're sweet people. How do i cope with them. I you know they're lovely people at their core you know. Copeton cuz i love them. I just stopped. No x i'll just. Go off of my own for a while. And. You know take a breather or whatever. Everyone makes me mad sometimes so. Challenging. I just i tried it doesn't work. Sometimes i have to take medication for it at to take ambien. Something like that. I'm someone who sleeps in late. So i always get at least six or seven hours if i have to wake up early for something. I get nauseous sometimes. I'll throw up in the morning. Yeah i've had jobs where i wake up and. Vomit while i'm brushing my teeth it's horrible. It does suck. It's kind of. Something i'm worried about you know i kind of need to get some part-time work while i'm. Not. You know. Getting a steady pay flow for my music production so. Yeah. Pretty rough. Got some stuff i need to get over i'm not really sure how. Just. Not feeling good getting nervous. When. You know there's something stressful like a stressful work environment or. Just something that doesn't sit. Well with me like. Being in a. Rushton. Yes stressful work environment adjust. Unless it's about something that i care about you know like music or the arts it's just very hard to. Give a s*** frankly. Like. And you know i try to psych myself into giving a s*** and. It just makes me sick you know maybe i'll have a red bull or something and then my body doesn't want that in the morning it just. Take my body rejects things and. Yeah. Okay. I've been feeling okay. Jeriah very reflective fair contemplative. Now it's going to be some changes and it's going to be. Some new people in my life. Some new people in my band. Yeah i'm going to try to push myself. But. Try to stay grounded at the same time cuz. And i expect more for myself. It's just. Pissing me off my. Bite me i'm busy feel like. S******* all over myself nobody sitting on me anyway. Spy. Being so. Shity. Yeah. No. Yes. I was diagnosed. 12 years ago i haven't been in therapy since. They gave me the zoloft and i don't like it. Made me feel worse than i do in the shittiest moment i was telling you about it it made me feel numb. I don't want to feel numb. I want to feel everything even if it sucks. Being forced to. This is private school. They thought i was acting up. I thought i was a pretty kid i think i was just being a kid. So. Yes. Idea. Well i haven't. Ben. And. Then 12 years. But i do think that it might be helpful for me in the future. I thought you weren't a therapist that's a typical therapist question right there. Oh yeah. I i kind of want to go back to therapy it might help. Might help me. Possible solutions maybe maybe it's not a therapist and it maybe it's a life coach i have no idea but. I'll be seeking help soon. Yesterday. I was watching a movie with my girlfriend. I looked over her smiling each other and. Yeah. Very honest. Sometimes barely so but i'm a good guy. I think that my friends all think i'm a guy. But funny. Open-minded. I guess that's what i'm working on which is trying to improve my discipline. And try to work through. My body rejecting shittiness. Of the world. It gets better. Stay in shape gets harder. Why are you at. Don't give up on your dreams keep doing what you're doing. My music. You're welcome miss talking to you. \n",
      "I'm just supposed to water i'm supposed to do something. Okay. Okay. You're welcome. Yes. I'm okay. Hello. There's a lot of variety there's a lot of health-oriented stuff. There's all kinds of food to eat you can go to the desert and go to the bingo anywhere i mean there's a lot. And the weather is great. The traffic. Lately the change in weather it's kind of a little too unpredictable. But it mainly the traffic and sometimes some rudeness of people. I want save-a-lot. Just occasionally. It's nice to get a change of scenery and different things to do that maybe i wouldn't normally do different people. Learning about different people different customs. Depends i mean if it's the water real pretty water and you know being in beautiful water. Relaxing. Adventure i love adventure. Some time ago i went to cayman islands and. Went on i get seasick but my sister gave me some medication i went on a boat and we snorkeled and there were two boats and i accidentally got back on the wrong boat. Yeah and they're really crazy they made me jump back into the water and swim to the right boat. And i thought i was going to drown because the water was kind of rough i was really shocked that they wanted me to do that. Yeah but i survived. Doing pretty good. Business management. But also. Also hypnotherapy. I didn't hear that other question. Well i came from a serious kind of families so that just seemed something that would be a universal that will cover a lot of different subjects. Yes. Yeah but yes or no i mean now i kind of wish it was something different. I like communication i love speaking and interviewing strangers i'm very outgoing and funny so. Probably would have been something more like either liberal arts communication. That type of thing. During job which is be out there you know like some of these people may be on tv exploring different places and getting paid for it and always like a fun adventure. Interacting with people. Doing things i haven't done before. And. Helping people. You know on some way with what i do cuz that they can see you know. But i'm uncoordinated and in some ways and you know they could be uncoordinated and have some fun too. I watch tv i go workout go walking i recently got like a bike that i kind of sort of fixed up. Go do something new go to a festival go grocery shopping. Interact with friends. Call them see them. That type of thing. Talk to strangers. Depends on the situation there's a bunch of time so i'm good at it. If it has to do with like traffic and cars it's a little more intense for me. her. Or. People were like really rude you know with the way they cut you off. Almost. Luckily not. You know i'm very assertive and maybe too much sometimes wear if somebody does something really rude to me in a parking lot aisle. I'll confront them on that sometimes. Might have been with my sister. I had to do with i'm not sure of the topic but whatever she was saying wasn't right and we got in an argument it sounds childish about who was right you know cuz she thinks she's always the smarter one cuz she's older. Sometimes it's frustrating cuz it's like it's a no-win situation she just wants to hammer on somebody till you know they acknowledge that she's right. Other times i just let it go and let her rattle on cuz it's. Those kind of non productive. I'm real close. 2ic my parents almost every weekend more close to my mother. Have a twin sister. I stay in touch with her even though she's out of town she lives out of town and i've got two other sisters so i stay in touch with. All of them. You know it's a mixed bag you know. We kind of assertive aggressiveness in us in a little bit. But also. Well me and. Ever i mean stranger sometimes my family you know they've done some nice things for me. Strangers shipping. Very. Sometimes unexpectedly very nice. I could be shopping and you know. Maybe i can't reach something and some guy i'll pop up behind me and you know without me saying anything just help me out to him. That type of thing or. If somebody's like kind of mean to me somebody all like. Commiserate you know. Attic. I had a situation years ago with a neighbor where he was really nasty to me cuz he thought i. Didn't like his dog was and i'm not crazy about dogs but he kind of flipped out for year-and-a-half and. Just said very nasty things to me when other people weren't around i wish i had confronted that back then. Because i. You know but it created a lot of anxiety for me cuz i feel like i could have nipped it in the bud and instead of having to deal with the. Major stress from it. Now he and i don't talk at all i just feel it's best it's kind of odd. God. Spin a lot. Sometimes breaking up with somebody or. Yeah sushi or getting rid of a friend. That type of thing. Sometimes i feel guilty about. Some of my past behavior with people. Or maybe i wasn't his understanding. When i was younger i stole things you know that's not the best behavior and. Kind of stuff like that. Oh god there's a lot of them. I wish i could erase you know how. Tough my dad was an assist children. And. Erase a lot of memories of men i dated that just didn't work out well at all. And. Meow. I can drop off like. Right away. Cranky irritated. Snarky. I've been out of sorts some i've had some anxiety with money in relationships cuz i haven't been in one for so long. Mail. Just a lot of anxiety. Take a deep breath. Trying to do positive things you know sometimes. Eat healthy or workout more talk to my friend about it. That type of thing. Try and look for interesting activities to do. To distract me. Will not officially but i know. You know from. Things have experience that i've had. When i get very anxious in certain situations. Yeah it's usually triggered by. Sometimes if somebody gets really angry and crazy it triggers a lot of anxiety in me if they're aggressive whether it be physically or verbally. Or sometimes if they're too much in my my space. You know where i am. Bothers me. A long time ago. Ages ago. Maybe over 10 years ago. 15 years ago. I was depressed i mean it's nothing to laugh about but i mean it's kind of. A circle. Just. 2. Wanted to be more positive and enjoy life more. I'm stuck in certain thoughts i'm having a lot of negative thoughts feeling. Hopelessness helplessness. That type of thing. I go occasionally it's a different type. I'll go see a hypnotherapist sometimes true. Release anxiety that's in me. Yes i do very useful. More awareness of myself and other people. Learning more control more confidence better self-esteem willing to try. Even more things you know whether i know the outcome or not you know of the unknown i'll experiment a lot more. Helping like at the 25th mile heading out water and there were some people there who are doing that for the first time also. Some event at my sisters were there were just a couple of us send. I was cracking a lot of jokes sometimes i'm like really funny you know and i can't even believe myself and i just go on and on you know what i want starts laughing i'm not even trying to and i'm just saying like regular stories and people look at me funny laugh. Yeah. As a really decent loyal empathetic. Deserving. Supportive. I'm hoping. Outgoing quirky. Type of person. Look be great to look even younger or be younger. If that was humanly possible. Be even more patient with people. I think you do not get frustrated like if i think somebody's not very smart. Sometimes it's real frustrating for me to be around some types of people. Well. Wow. Make a lot of money and plan for your future. And. Try and be as kind of impatient with people as possible and have a lot of fun try new things. I think of my mind and my perseverance that. I changed a lot of things within my personality. I feel proud of volunteer work i feel proud i felt a bunch of people lose weight declutter their homes and helped. Create a lot of positive change in people. Okay. It was nice talkin to you. Or she nods her head a lot. The game. \n",
      "Somebody put that. Drago right over here so. Okay. Yes. I'm doing pretty good thank you. I was born in the san fernando valley california. Really. I love the beaches. I like this is many things to do. And i can't beat the weather. Traffic cost of living. I know i haven't. I've only been out of the country wants. Are few times actually only one other country. Well. They were when i was younger before i turn 21 and we used to. Go to tijuana cross the border just to get into nightclubs and stuff like that. I love to seeing new things me places in heaven experiences. After high school i went to beauty school. For cosmetology. All the time i was. Looking for a career change and. I have some friends in the industry and. I decided to take classes and see see what i thought. Only as a hobby. Well. That's a tough one answer i got to think about that. I would be on the outgoing side. Just because. I'm more outgoing than i am shy. A lot of times i smoke marijuana. Not the best. I had an argument with my mother over. How we should handle doing things with my grandmother. Well we just had differences on. You should do what it what times and who's in control and. That's pretty much let her. Follow her rules because it's you know she's her daughter. It's okay i understood we talked it out and. I realize that. I might have been. Overstepping my bounds. I. Fairly good i am pretty close with my mom and my grandmother. I have a stepfather and a half brother. We get along okay but we're not very close. And i've never met my real father. Maybe not accomplishing as much as i. Should have in my life up to now. Yeah maybe. By not having enough ambition or drive to. Being a better position of my life. Well one of the hardest decisions was when i moved moved away from los angeles to wisconsin. Well when i was younger i was getting in trouble and i was looking for a way out so i. Wouldn't continue getting into trouble and i. With a friend we just pack your bags and move to milwaukee. Yes. Extremely difficult. I guess. I got a lot of things going on. Or not going on and it just makes it hard for me to sleep. Issues in my life. And. Sure sometimes. I guess it depends on what i have to do. Right now. A little. The last few minutes since we started talking about. Depressing stuff. Starting to feel a little more down. I haven't. No. Very seldom. Stop thinking about him. I don't know. Nantucket answer that right now. I guess i felt the. Well stepping really happy. I have a lot of very happy thoughts. That's recently. Oci had to go las vegas. A couple months ago. Had a good time there. Well i am i. Honest person. For the most part reliable. I think i'm easy to get along with. Why would i start. I plenty of. Bad decisions i could. Erase. Yeah well i have a dui on my record. Well. The time is suspending my license makes it extremely different makes life extremely difficult. Oh yeah that's a. Hard to get around when you can't drive legally. And if you do drive illegally you're at risk. Of going to jail. For driving without a license. Well the original charge did but i haven't. Got caught driving. Sense. I don't have a best friend. Well it's come back to that one. Maybe that i could. Follow through some of my plans. Be a little more ambitious. Maybe not. Some of the decisions i've made in my life i've regrets. I take care of business first. And always handle your responsibilities. God. Good weather. Good music to company. The conversation. Wow i don't have an answer for you. I love to. Bike ride i can go for walks or hikes i love to swim in the ocean. My mom. Well she. She was a single mom with two kids and. Worked really hard. To raise us. Yeah it wasn't easy. Fairy. Sure. Bye. Okay. \n",
      "Alright. Yes. Very well. New york. This turn the volume up a little bit. For change. That's good. Wanted to see what los angeles was about. Probably took a year to. Being away from. My family being away from. What i was used to in new york the neighborhood's the people and just getting. Acclimated to a whole new lifestyle here. All the weather. Can't beat the weather generally always nice. It's not too hot it's not too cold. It's creative i do like. Anna movies. I like the beach. The traffic. A lot of traffic. Some of those sometimes i think people are a little bit colder here then. More distant and unfriendly than other places. I was a history major. No. I do like demonstrations in. Behind supermarkets. To be a screenwriter. That's one of the reasons why i came to los angeles. It's hard cuz i don't always maintain focus and motivation. What other things. Distract me. I was i've always been interested in films ever since i was a child. And i was just always do know was rioting and had an active imagination. In the last. Probably. Almost 10 years i've traveled more than i had in the past i've always traveled even as a kid my parents would travel around. Oh yes. Seeing new places and seeing people that are different than i am. Saying how they live. And. Taking in the sights. I went to kenya that was probably one of the best trips ever went on. On the safari inn. Just going out in a jeep and seeing wild animals in their own. Natural habitat was pretty incredible. Oh yeah that's one of the great experiences of my life. And i also got two. A place in egypt. At the end of that trip. I'm called. Sharm el sheikh which is right on the water and it has some of the best scuba diving in the world which is hard to believe that. Egypt would but it was just amazing how i didn't go scuba diving i went snorkeling. What do i do to relax i do i like to listen to music. I like to help and watching movies help me relax cuz it takes me out of you know whatever. Might be on my mind. Do meditate everyday. I like to take walks in nature that's always calming. Especially down by the the ocean. Depends sometimes i get angry. And lose my temper a lot of times. Do like a form of self-hypnosis and calm myself. This is something i've recently learned how to do. This is very helpful. And also since i meditate it doesn't i don't get. Annoyed at things. As easily as i did in the past. Some things that make me really mad. I guess i think of injustice. And the world are done to people. When. It doesn't really need to be that way that we could all get along. And to make the world better. About last night. I went to a movie screening. Abba independent film and i didn't think it was done very well not so much that we had a fun argument. About a. About the movie. So that was like going out that this happened yesterday so that was. That's on my mind. Is there anything i regret. Yeah there's there are have been opportunities in my life. That i wished i had. Taking them and pursue them. A certain jobs. You know when i first got the los angeles i had an opportunity to. Become a grip. Anna. And i. I probably should have pursued that. I would like to side it to do that i don't really understand the questions. Take advantage of every opportunity that came my way. I think saying yes. Any opportunity is is very important in the matter. How you feel you have to be confident that you'll be able to achieve what you want to do. Now. No. Now but i've been depressed in my life. I'll for the most part i've been feeling good sometimes i feel a little blue. I think sometimes if i if i allow a. Regret the come into my mind. That can bring me down. But i can you know. Usually get out of it pretty quickly. I'll sometimes financial concerns sometimes. An opportunity. How do i explain it. The financials 15 made another decision i might have more money or my life would be different. Not really i mean i feel. Pretty much the same. Got me to sea kelp for. Let's come back to that. Fall cabal. Gently talking to someone who's helped. When i did do that. Stop pretty easy. I don't have problems sleeping. Call. Doodly i'm grumpy. So if i don't sleep well. Then i feel tired and irritable. How would my best friend describe me. What's good question. I'm definitely friendly and outgoing. Little bit secretive. Probably that i should be. I'd like to see me more accomplished and attaining my goals. Maybe a little happier. I think. It stopped at the pants. Sometimes i'm very introverted cuz i do like to write so that takes. He's alive to spend time alone and then when i come out of that. Extraverted so i don't really see myself. As one hard way or the other it all depends on my on the situation in my mood. My best qualities. I think i'm caring. I think i'm intelligent. I think i'm funny. I'm outgoing. I have a likeable personality. And people have said that. I'm engaging but not oppressive or overly engaging there's a soda cool detachment. Home and creative intuitive. Yes. Awesome i felt really happy. I'll i woke up this morning i was pretty happy. At breakfast i was happy. Sun was shining. I think like i said going to kenya. What's up memorable experience. Scuba snorkeling was a really great. Spiranto disremember jail scene. All the colors in the ocean. And i'll. And feeling the sun powerful sun on my back. Almost beyond. Almost beyond like. 2 minute away this warrant touch with like everything the universe. That would be nice to feel that way every moment of the day but. One of my most proud of in my life. I think i've. Helped. People. Sometimes when they were in crisis. And i've written some screenplays. Pat some good relationships. Good relationships just being connected with someone else you know. Spending time with them. Bent connecting. An emotional. Physical one. Methyl levels. It could be a song that i hear on the radio. It could be. Lot of times looking forward to something you know if. I'm going to go to a movie go bowling. Hang out with people. You know looking at work. And then going to work and feeling productive and put me and puts me in a good mood. You're welcome. Bye-bye. Huh. Like what do you remember what. Got it got it. \n",
      "Might have. Polson. Great thanks so much. Yes. I'm fine little tired but i found out my thyroid is i think acting up. I was born in canada. But i've lived in california most of my life so. And it's gray today too so the gray weather makes you kind of see no sluggish. Oh my gosh years and years ago. Not at all i don't think i can text her. For a long time. Well the airfares have gone up quite a bit in the last few years gas prices have gone up so. Travel as much as it's a fun thing to do it's cost-prohibitive so. Oh that's see everything have pluses and minuses. Cold weather not as much sun so i think i'd prefer getting more sun and. Having the warm weather so but other than that. It's some it's very pretty back their natural scenery and. But i like it here you know the traffic is kind of heavy but that's a small thing to deal with. Why did i move to la because my family came here and started. My dad got a job here and. This became our home base and. That's why. Easy very easy. So. Well in high school you generally study general ed. They have designated courses and then after that. Went to college and i was a business major let's say i was a veterinary major. And i graduated with a degree in liberal arts. I don't know. Can't really pinpoint. I was working in social services but i've also worked in sales and most recently i'm doing real estate. Molesting consultant part-time. I mean everything has platinum minuses it's it's okay it's not. I don't really see too many negatives. Oh. Probably to work as a gossip columnist it. Tmz are one of those networks. But as you know everything in the entertainment business is very competitive it's who you know so. But that would be my dream job or probably working with cats you know animals. So. I'm very outgoing in fact i think i'm so echoing i scare people sometimes. There's a lot of quiet you know reserve people out there so. I'm kind of east coast ferry. And i go up to people and talk to them first social. Oh my gosh there's i could do hundreds of things i could read i could watch a show turn on the music music is great. Take a walk call my friends. Million thing so. I'm pretty good i'm very good i mean you know of course when you're driving in la and somebody. Cuts in front of you sometimes i can be irritating but i'm i'm actually pretty i'm not the type of person that will fight her. Did i don't like to have confrontation. I can't really remember. So that's why i said there's not very many arguments. Usually i. Avoid arguments at any cost. I don't really feel guilty about anything right now or that i can think of. I can't think of anything right now. Really can't think of any decisions that were really hard. I mean most it's pretty easy for make me to make a decision. So i don't have a family so if i have to you know i had to move to san francisco for a job once but. Since i'm single it's i don't really have to consider other people and children in. That type of thing so kind of makes. Certain things easier when you don't have other family to consider. An event. Well obviously you don't you know the passing of a family member you know you wish everybody could be around forever. Sino on my father died you know i mean. I wish i would have had them for a lot longer need died at the age of 77 and you know what have been nice to have him around a little bit more. Can't control those things life has its own. Way of dealing with. Yes there are. Yin and yang. Ancient. Philosophy and it really applies there's pluses and minuses the negatives and positives. Well like i said my dad's no longer here and my mother and i know we have our differences i think mothers and daughters always do. My brother and i get along great i see him a lot my sister works a lot. I see her and you know we talked and she's kind of got her own life and her children i get along great with them. So. We have a small family. Once again it's like that's a hard question to answer there's so many. Types of kids out there i think. Majority of them seem to be pretty well-behaved i mean you know there's always going to be children that or can out of control. But. I don't know the ones that i've seen recently they're very. Well-behaved. Can't say much. Else about that. Well. I live in an apartment. And i don't know if you've ever lived in apartment but. There's someone that lives above me i'm on the first floor and there's somebody on the second floor in there. Pretty quiet but. They have a habit of. I guess they have lots of energy they usually will take their showers around midnight and sometimes will start washing laundry at midnight and of course the pipes. Run through the bedroom wall. That sounds like niagara falls and they are and so i don't yeah and i need 8 hours of sleep and i've only been getting. Oh i'd say like maybe 6 hours and then i usually wake up once at night take a sometimes they'll. Kind of around 2 or 3 in the morning go either walk around or i'll hear something so. I'm not getting a straight 8 hours of sleep and it's definitely. But there's not like i said there's things you can't control when you live in an apartment you know i means that the ladies look very quiet it's just that she has a habit of. You know. Taking later showers question clothes at night that's. I can't say anything to her about that. Yeah but you know there's people that are in worse situations so i don't make a lot out of it you know and i just it's not like every night but it's you know. At least twice a week so you know i've reconsidered maybe sleeping in another room but. For now you know that's i'll deal with it so. Tired very tired. Hard to focus hard to concentrate it just takes me longer to get things done cuz i don't have my energy also i haven't been exercising i normally try to walk about half an hour a day but. The weather has been kind of colder and kind of dreary urso. You know i'm not as motivated when the weather is kind of blah so it's a combination of both not getting my exercise and not getting eight hours sleep. Have i said before tires. The combination of the weather you know i'm here in los angeles right now we have been having very gray days i live very close to the ocean. So the sun doesn't come out that much so i'm not getting my serotonin i need that. I. I'm not getting my 8 hours of sleep because you know. Whatever and i think my thyroid is acting up too so that's kind of. Creating and i have some vitamin deficiencies. And. You don't want to send comes out i'm kind of more energetic it just gives you that more energy. No. No. I have i'm happy most of the time i'm a pretty happy person. And i like to be around other people i mean of course i like my private time but i do like being around people quite a bit so. Can't think of anything right now i mean i usually enjoy everything i do there's nothing that stands out more than anything else. No i never regret anything. What advice would i have given well i guess yeah i could probably change things around i think. Everybody could. I probably would have had a different college major. It seems like. What else i probably wouldn't have dated. Waste of time with certain people. I don't know those are them things that come to mind. Maybe started saving money earlier. You know those types of things. Outgoing lots of fun to be with. I just said good friend to have people like having me for a friend i'm loyal trusting and. I listen i'm a good listener i'm very patient as well so. Well i never wanted me to lose weight but. I think that's a worldwide problem i mean there's a lot of. Food around temptations and. Especially here in america a lot of us are couch potatoes we sit in front of our computers we. You know it's just easy to real it's so easy to relax you know it's hard to get up and move around you have to talk yourself into it so. That's the way that you know house gives you more energy to if you lose weight so that's a big thing as well but that's probably the thing just the weight thing you. I think you might have asked me that question before her. But if you want i'll repeat it so. I'm very like i said i'm very loyal when i tell people i'm going to do something i do it very reliable. I am warm i'm very friendly and great listener. And i mean i've heard so many people tell me they just like being with me so i can said i'm very pretty upbeat you know i'm. Don't let things get me down too much so. That's a hard question. Can't think i mean i'm. Can't think they had answer that one. For fun well i love movies so i could say every movie that they make. I love going out with my friends. Shopping swap meets my gosh. Traveling is great road trips. Kind of. We do. Part of it. I mentioned. Traveling getting to see different places the history aspect of it. The food's join foods in different countries. The architecture. It's just. Kind of need to get away and see a completely different place. Okay well. I've been. To a lot of places in europe i love paris it's such a. Walking city you can. Whoever designed that city i'll tell you i mean if you can get from one point to another the subways are great. Each area has its own distinctive kind of there's a latin quarter with the students are. There's another area where let's say the fashion designers are. Kind of like our rodeo drive here in beverly hills there's an area that is more. African and they have swap meets in the weekends that are wonderful is for international. And then like i said when she get out of paris there's just so much history you can go see. Versailles diner. Other palaces you can go to the south of france you know. But that's probably my favorite country i've been to italy as well so. Yeah well after college you people usually i mean people that go to college or either before or after college. That's a great time to go to europe because you're young and you're not tied down you don't have a family in. You kind of have a more adventuresome spirit you got more energy so carrying you know backpack or suitcases it's not. Not a big deal. So yeah that's. Thank you. Goodbye. Oh that was that was fast but i didn't. \n",
      "Okay great. Thank you. Yes. Doing pretty good. All i was born in brooklyn new york i came out here when i was seven. And i've been here ever since i don't consider myself anything but oak. California. I'm a welder. I just. I don't know it was something about. Making and building things and repairing things that intrigue me and. I was actually pretty good at it and so i stuck with it and and that's my profession. T.i. really never had that i've just. Kind of always hope that i would have a job that could support myself and my family and. I was satisfied with that. Well i just recently lost my uncle and he raised me since i was 7 years old. And. Other than my wife i don't have any more family. He passed away last july. And i'm. Starting to get over it. I knew the day would come but he was my last living relative so. I've been depressed about that and. But i'm doing better. It depends on the atmosphere. If i'm around people that i don't feel comfortable with. Kind of reserved. But if i'm comfortable. Randolph. I feel like i fit in about going. I enjoy old movies old well it's called film noir and i love those old black-and-white movies and i get on netflix or amazon and. I try to pick a movie that. From back then people were different than day. I don't know it's just a different era and i enjoy it. No. My wife says i probably not as good as i think i do but. I've got to admit sometimes i lose my temper. Pandit is according to her over things that i shouldn't be losing my temper about. But. I'm working on it and. I. I have basically i just problem ever since i was young child. Oh yes. I've been in and out of trouble with the law when i was much younger i'm past that point now but. You know when you're young you think you know everything and you know you never going to get ahold in the future doesn't matter. But it does matter because everything that you do when you're young. Follows you for the rest of your life. I don't regret things that i've done but if i could go back i definitely would make different choices. Me and my wife we. We don't argue we disagree and it's. She's very strong-willed and she's a match for me so. We go back and forth but we don't get violent and we don't.. Say mean for things or hurt each other we're just. She is. I determined strong-willed woman and. I am who i am so. We kind of go back and forth and. Lately i have been the one to. Bow down and be the one to lower the threshold of the argument because in the long run. It just heard me. And there's nobody else more important to me. When i was younger i wish that i didn't follow some of the people that i followed. And what i mean by that is no running in a circle with certain people and. Having an ego bigger than my common sense and. That's what got me into trouble. I was an only child. And. I kind of enjoyed being the center of attention and. Getting the girls to laugh or having people. Think i was going to cool to whatever you wouldn't think that now i'm kind of overweight involving but. When i was in my twenties i was at a complete different person and. If i would have had some brothers and sisters i may not have thought or acted that way but i was an only child so. I. Call fran where. People thought it was cool and that got me into trouble. Hardest decision ever had to make was. Giving the authorization. 2. Have my uncle passed away he was on life support and his kidneys had failed. And. Doctor said there was nothing more i could do and to not have him. Go through any suffering. 2. Let him slip away. Michigan sea i get very upset. My uncle. Raised me like his own son and. Never let me down. And he's gone and. For lack of a better word to push the button i never thought i would have to do that. But as i said i'm getting over it and. Things are getting better slowly. My wife. She is always there for me. She will always surprise me we she's not my wife she's my best friend and she knows me better than i know myself. We enjoy. Doing simple things. It's not that we can't do other things if we wanted to but we mesh we enjoy each other's company we like the same things and we. You don't occasionally go out and do something together but we. We just enjoy each other's company and she. Like i said he knows me better than anybody and i'm it surprised me sometimes. You know lately well i can't say lately if i don't excuse me if i don't do. A rigorous activity or something that. Really. Stresses me or strains my body. Let's say for a couple of days i'm just very relaxed and you know not doing much. I just automatically get up after four and a half 5 hours. I mean and you're my wife assist. I am not getting any sleep but. I mean i don't feel tired i don't feel exhausted i don't feel like i need to go back to sleep. I'll stay up all day and. I'm fine and most people will say that's not enough sleep but. Enough for me i'm. It doesn't affect me. Where are with some things could be different but i'm not dissatisfied. I'm happy with my life that they're like with anybody else there's a few things that i wish would different and i think that's an anybody everybody else's you know life. But dumb. I'm content. Yeah i feel a little less motivated. Recently well i can't say recently this was back in january. My wife and a few friends were. Noticing that i was. Becoming forgetful and i couldn't remember things. I didn't see it. And. You know when they when everybody brought it to my attention then i started to. Anyway i went to the doctor and. They gave me the tests. And apparently i have mci which is mild cognitive impairment. And. Over the last month or so. Nobody has mentioned it to me i'm a maybe i'm getting better but. Dead neurologist that i saw. The ad having me come back in a year and going to retest me. I'll play it's not the beginning stages of alzheimer's i'm still a little young for that i'm only 52 but. I was diagnosed with a mild cognitive impairment. It could have been due also i was told by him. Because of the death of my uncle ike. Very depressed and i. To retain things. Tell. Woke i'm going back in a year and we'll see if i'm any better. I'm sorry. I'm not understanding you i'm sorry. No no i have not. Yes. 2001. I was. In a. What is the word i'm looking for i was in a. In a state of mind of where i was just going to get myself in trouble and and not benefit anything if i didn't seek any help. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder. Waring and thinking too much about things and. I thinking the worst. Panda. I i take medication for that. Well you know it's not really therapy it's. You know every few months you know you got to see the doctor. Are you doing fine everything good and you know they just refill your prescription. It's kind of like the next person next person that is i am with kaiser so. It's it's they'll talk to you but it did they give you the impression that. Being ohio okay let's move along you know that that they'll hear your explanation but. You know. They don't have all the time for you that you may want so. I am doing fine now if i really needed help i would. I would do something with the medication works for me. Last time i felt real happy. Well it would depend on what the event is i'm always happy when i'm doing something with me and my wife and we're enjoying each other and i ain't no i'm not trying to sound like she's my whole world and i don't have anything else she is my world but. I enjoy being with her and we we we do things together and. I am i'm happy all the time when we're doing that. When i'm outside of that circle. I don't know if the sounds right but i'm not seeking happiness i i can only explain it as i'm contempt. I'm not. I'm not disappointed or i'm not wanting anything i'm being whatever comes my way is fine so. Well. I don't know why i couldn't give you that answer. I want my best friend is my wife but the. She would. Describe me is. I don't think before i speak. I. Let the littlest insignificant things. Bother me and i get angry over but the big things it's like. I let it go and she's. Bewildered by that. Years and years ago. Shiiit classic pontiac lemans and she had got into a minor fender-bender. And she thought it was going to be the end of the world cuz that was my baby. And i. You know it don't worry i'll get it fixed. And she what she thought was going to hang or something you know because that was my this was no but it was my baby and she. You get excited over nothing but. Something like wrecking your car that you love and you put so many hours of work into it money. It all gets crashed and it's like you don't care. South. That's the only way i can explain it. Well i need to lose some weight if you could say i'm definitely been on an eating binge. And the neurologist said that's probably due to. The event with my uncle. I am just the heaviest i've ever been in my life. And i'm finding a load to harder. I can't say harder but i'm finding. The willpower. Just say no and stick with it into go exerciser. I don't know.. Movement now gourmet before walking on me and my wife and we were. Hello but younger we used to love going for walks and we lived in a. Hey boy you don't look at that wonder what's inside their er at destin that we don't do that no more. I guess it's. Where do bit older now and. Something heavy retarded a walk with all this week but i ate i wish i could change that because. This is not healthy. Precise. Lately. No i don't regret anything lately. Everything's been fine the. I can say that. The biggest. Biggest impact on my life was the event with my uncle. Panda. I never ever. In a hundred years there ever thought that i would. Face tattoo. Situation. And. I'll never forget it. But. They say time heals all wounds and and it does. Don't listen to other people. Again i'm not trying to bring up my uncle just because of what has happened but he used to constantly tell me to. He would see the things that i was doing in the pads that i was going down and i constantly thought i knew better and i think a lot of youngsters think that anyway they. The young lady that i was talking to in here they think. They're invincible and so did i. I figured i'd never going to god i'm never going to have those problems. I wish i could have changed some things. The history of my past follows me as it does everybody. And that has limited me and in a lot of opportunities and a lot of things that i'm able to do. I don't miss them but. If i could go back 10 or 20 years i definitely wouldn't make some of the decisions and i made. My welding certificates certified by the american welding society and i. That's probably the biggest achievement that i made for you know myself an accomplishment. People that i know say that i'm. Well i haven't been working on cars lately but they said that i have a natural knack for. Restoration and working on vehicles and i don't see it but. I've been told that. Once or twice but i i've kind of. I've kind of started to slip away from that i don't like i can't say from lack of interest but. I just don't feel the motivation no more. I wish i had a pocket of money and i have somebody else to it that's how i feel. Okay. Well thank you. Bye-bye. Hey. Okay. I'll tell you know after a couple of minutes. \n",

Just lay down watch movie listen to some music. Basically hip hop music. Or maybe. A good comedy movie. Fairly easy about it. Hourly. Let go get let my bad side gets my emotions. Probably earlier today about with my girlfriend. Her wife basically about. Where we going to go eat. Spell desperate for an answer for her to tell me where she wanted to go eat. She wouldn't make up her mind kind of made me. Uneasy. Play just. To relax and stay calm more than just to outburst and raise my voice. Wrongdoings in my past basically. Anything i could have changed. How to better myself. Basically. Doing something better at a job or maybe. Not doing the job at my greatest. Hardest decision would have to be. To plan a family probably. I'm just basically. Making sure all the situations are where they're supposed to be and. Talking it out with my partner. Nipple ready ready to. Begin a family. Just basically. The love and bond between me and my wife. Basically might be like a crash accident. Basically. Pretty horrifically. Scary experience. Why not i almost crashed into.

Just after you realized it the first time try not to do it again. Tell us a mistake doesn't happen. My persona kind of as far as a. Whenever i'm angry. Is 2. Find a way to be more easygoing. Maybe try to. Not be so much of a negative thinker at times when when things get a little harder. Basically when somebody. Accuses you of. Wrongdoing that probably has hasn't been done. Basically one. Police officer tells you you've done wrong when you clearly know that you have not done. Anything wrong. Play. Earlier this year. Basically. Police officer pulled me over for thinking that i was a drunk driver made me feel really really dumb all by myself or try to accuse me of wrongdoing that i've been drinking and smoking when that was not the cause.

My homie was getting like ambushed by these three big ol security guards. And then you know what i saw have been handsome my friend that's when i really lost it. And i every other good look on my friend right now he's like what you going to do it said i'm like what you going to do and then like he threw me to the ground and he had his arm over me i put my arm over him and threw him to the ground and then it got broken up. 2000 last time. I got angry. I was cool as fun. Life. Hello. Maybe that maybe that situation could have been handled differently. It could have been handled differently if they would have been handling things differently than i wouldn't have to react. It's not like i was mad i was acting off of reaction i had to act like that. Because like justice like i couldn't it was on jessie was like. I'm not a mean person at all but when i saw one of my loved ones getting tagged and i had to like come in like you know like react to that. And they were the hot and i mean i was like yeah niggars is tripping when i yell. Chillout is the tiny little i dude your humongous ass mexican exile you need to fall back. Lucchese. Guilty. I don't know i still should sometime from stores when i'm hungry. If i got no money. I got an early guilty could actually yeah i don't feel guilty about that. Food should be free. And i mean. But i. I don't know. I like everybody laughing sound like sometimes. I would like little like idol hearing their exaggeration. Nada never. The hardest. I guess. I don't even know what the hardest decision was but i get faced with hard decisions. And those would be like. I got so many friends sometimes. I can't really hang out with everybody in one weekend. Those that got to make decisions like if i go over this sector the town i'm going to hang out with xyz niggars i go over here xyz evening so it's like you know. Those are hard decisions cuz i never like to let anybody down. Stuff like that deciding between friends to hang out with. It's cool i live in my mom. I come home like every 3 to 4 days. Who. What can you repeat the question. My auntie. She's just really nice and she's like a little sweet little blind old lady who cooks for the good. As tight i don't know. Something i could erase for my memory. I want to want to erase anything from my memory. Cuz that'll be like. Because like. The experiences you go through make you who you are who you are. Think weak people like that want to erase things or block things out like. That doesn't exist i mean there should that's been hard. But i would never say i would not want that to happen. Cuz you know you must got to learn from the experience you know i mean to be the better you. All i said is like a it's like a test you know. That bad experience just testing you got overcome. And be stronger and not just like curl up and be like oh my god life hard. That's it for weak people. I don't believe in that. I have compassion for people who do get a hoodoo want to do stuff like that but i still like i don't see the logic in it. I mean i stay up pretty late and do all sorts of a regular stash it but when i am home. It's really easy i could just go to sleep you know when i get tired i get tired. Lately i've been on this site i've been partying helen tough lately like oh my god for at least six days.

And yeah i was just somebody else going out with but i just broke up with me in like that s*** sucks. That's why the last time i got felt really bad about myself. What exactly we want to know about that. Oh i got. We're just going out and then she was just hella jealous and going through my phone sometimes we accuse me shaving and sheena breaking up with me. It's cuz she wanted to like mess around with other people. And i was a relationship in a nutshell. Life sucks you got to adapt and change man. Nowadays. Don't walk from it run to jose.

Sam kissing had the shaking babies along the way and it's been a ride fantastic time. Headache only get bigger and better. Are you sure. Whoa. Totally. Bye. I love you. You love you too.

      "Let me have you. Alright. Okay sure. Yes. I'm not bad i'm a little tired but okay. From st louis missouri. Yep. 2 months ago. Not often i think i'm out here for good now. Smaller town less people everyone kind of acts different the pace of life is slower out there. Looking for work as a game designer and developer just. Try something new to new place new people. I guess i'm still getting used to it. I guess. People are different you know there's little shops everywhere just. Everything's different. The weather's great out here. People are really nice. Like to look at the mountains the beach is nice just better geography. Traffic. I guess the commute. And sometimes there's maybe too many people. I'm sure you can. Not really never been outside of the us before. Ups never had the opportunity i'd love to go though. A game design and graphic design sort of. I love it. I'm playing video games since i was a kid like most guys my age so. Just like making people happy and it's kind of easy to do that with games. Work for myself make my own games write my own paychecks i guess. A pretty hard i've been trying to do it for the past couple years it's a little difficult. I guess i'm kind of shy it depends on the people in the environment i guess. Play guitar listen to some music talk to friends. Play i'm pretty good at controlling my temper i'm not the type of guy that gets angry really easily. Probably with my girlfriend over something silly i can't even remember. Don't know i don't think i'm really guilty about anyting try to avoid. Being guilty. Don't know. Can't really think of anything. Leaving st louis was one of them is all my friends and family were there. I guess the benefits outweighed. You know the cons. Definitely. Maybe getting kicked out of high school first time. Just i ended up getting myself and then my friends in trouble and. It was just now good you kind of look back on it and. I guess that's something for my pastor wish i would have done different. Follow the rules i guess just been a good student would have helped. Not really that close with my family i've got a small family anyway and. When i was in st louis we'd see each other a couple times a year but that's really it so no strong ties. I guess most of my friends are always there to support me and encourage me and help me so. It's a pretty easy every once in awhile there's a night i can't sleep but it's pretty rare. Just tired and groggy yes my minds unfocused and. Day goes by a heck of a lot longer. I'm pretty good. Not really much to say. Maybe a little bit more depressed cuz i'm away from most of my friends and family but nothing unmanageable. Try to talk to him when i can think about something else think about a happy times. No. No. I guess on the drive out here. It was such a new experience in. So exhilarating. I think graduating college those really proud of myself and really looking forward to the future. Just. I guess kind of euphoria standing there it seems kind of surreal. Funny caring nice guy. Easily along with. Pretty happy being me i guess. Guess what i broke up with my last girlfriend for obvious reasons we tend to fight and say things you wish you'd forget i guess. Now i don't like to live in the past so there's nothing to really regret. Keep working hard and just. You keep thinking about what you do before you do it. On the computer playing video games with friends. Music. And my friends i guess. I guess my determination might have my passion. My creativity. Alright. \n",
      "Thank you. Yes. I'm wonderful how are you. California. Yes. The weather. It's one of them. Ava food. And the way i everything is centrally located. The traffic. The smog. And. It's just gotten really really overcrowded. I wouldn't say a lot but i do try to. Travel. At least. Once. Once or twice every two years. Just exploring different things and being able to. Have different experiences. Things of that nature and you know. Learning new things and dumb. Just different cultures ii like to. Learn about different cultures and when you travel. You get a sense of. You know feedback from different cultures and different areas so i like that. Well i just came from miami last year i went to miami for a week and a half. It was really nice the weather was great it was my first time going. And i'm the weather was wonderful the people are really nice. And it was really a great experience i went out there for. A particular event they have. Something every year where everyone comes out from all over. And i just kind of party and hang out and meet new people was really fun. Well from that trip i would say. Swimming and the beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. Miami beach waters was wonderful. Yeah it was. Child development. Well. I've always been interested in children since i was younger. My babies had a lot so i had a lot of experience with kids at a young age and as i grew older i realize that it was something that i like to do. I'm so. That's when i am looking to child development courses. And i thought that it was something like that i wouldn't enjoy doing so. I started taking classes and the rest of history. I am yes it's been 15 years in august. Yeah. What's your address. My dream job. I would say. To become a principal. Well it's something that i thought about doing for a while now and. I've actually just began the steps to try to get that going. So i'm going to be back in school and i'm going to be taking courses. I'm so that i can make that happen because it is a dream of mine thank you. How hot is it. It's going to be pretty difficult there is several years of schooling that i have ahead of me. And you know it's definitely going to be a challenge but it's something that i'm up for because it is a dream job of mine so it's something that i'm willing to i'm willing to do. A little bit of both. I think a little bit of both i can be shy at times. In-n-out going as well. But i think a little bit of both i would say. What i'm feeling. I know it's not hawaii. What are you doing. I meditate i am a big big meditator so i love meditating. I love just reading and just having nice quiet peaceful time. Oh wow i'm very very good at that. Very good at controlling my temper again. Series of. Meditation that i do. It involves deep breathing and. Just really censoring yourself. To where you can feel your heartbeat and you can. I'm really feel everything in your body. It really really allows you to distress and to. Control anxiety and anger and things of that nature yeah that helps me a lot. Oh wow. It was just recently actually unfortunately. It was last week and it was with my husband. And. It was about. Just the way he responds sometimes to me. I can be a little aggressive. And we're just trying to work with that because i don't respond well to aggression. I totally tuned out and that's actually what happened so yeah that was it. I felt. Very frustrated. And i actually felt angered to. But more frustrated and i felt fat and too because i don't like arguing so. It was a little bit of all those emotions at one time. Tell me about it. Situation was i wish i would have handled differently. Honestly i haven't had a situation like that and. And years i've pretty much kind of. You know kind of mastered more responses. Certain. Stimuli i kind of got back down. Tell me about the hardest. The hardest decision i've ever had to make. Well it was when i was 16 years old and i became a teenage. Mother. I was pregnant at 16 ends. I had. Lot of pressure from family too. Give my child up for adoption or two. I'm aboard. And i told life so that was that was one of the hardest decisions is not the hardest decisions to make as a sixteen-year-old teenage teenager just whether i wanted to continue to be a kid and a teenager. Or whether i wanted to embark on raising a life when i was just a child myself so that i think was the hardest decision. I had to make. Wow i mean my son is almost 19 now so it's 19 years later. And i actually am so glad it was one of the best things that i ever did by. Not choosing to avoid him and chew being pro-life. Pro-choice for life and. And i have not regretted the decision that's my only child and i love him he's just a blessing he's just a blessing and i feel very special to be islam. I do ya. I know it's not easy it definitely has its difficulties. I'm just as anything. But at the end of the day it is really rewarding. And you just get to see the life that you brought into the world and that you've raised become productive citizen and go out in society and start making their way and it's really rewarding it really is. What are some ways that your dinner. Oh wow. So many ways. The first one the first way is i actually listened to my son and i. Except his feedback even if i don't like it. And i allow him to express his self. Fortunately unfortunately when i was little. There was not a lot of conversation. From parent to child it was more like we were just told you know what to do and we did it. And with my son i give him options. Allow him to express itself. Allow him to give me feedback negative or positive because i feel that it's really important for a child to develop their voice at a young age. And i'm at your parents you have to be supportive and that and kind of. Make sure that you nurture that because that's kind of. The way that they develop you now and it's really really important so. I'm different and i and a lot of ways and that right. Thank you. Well. It depends sometimes it it really depends it depends on the time that i go to sleep it depends on the time that i woke up. That's a lot of factors i can't just give you one answer i would say that. It varies sometimes i can go to sleep and fall asleep right away and other times i can go to sleep and it might take a while to actually fall asleep so it varies. How you been feeling. I've been feeling great lately i really have been. I can't say that likes of last week didn't affect me you know the argument with my husband but. Other than that i have been feeling really good. Have you ever been. No i haven't. No i have not. You know what honestly i feel happy everyday you know everyday i wake up. I'm happy because that is a chance for me to. Take it back carpe diem seize the day so i feel blessed every morning i wake up it's a blessing you know because i realize that some people did not wake up some people are homeless some people are going through so many situations that are really disheartening. And that's not me so i feel really really blessed everyday. Thank you. As. Nurturing patient loving. Friendly. Kind of reserved. What are some things you wear. Well i wish that i had already completed college and had my master's degree. And sometimes i wish i was a little bit more knowledgeable and certain subjects. And i can change that if i could change anything i would change that those two things. And also i would be a little bit more outgoing and less of an introvert. You know what no regrets no regrets. You live and learn nothing is perfect. Everything that i've gone through had made me the person that i am today. So i wouldn't change anything because i'm happy with the person i am today. Oh man to stay in school to stay in school and to get your education and put that first and foremost before relationship. Even before your career i really really would have told myself. Stay focused and to. Get a great education. I'm most proud of. Where i come from. Everything age mother. Being a statistic and actually changing that. Being on my fame i've had my. Same job for 15 years now i'm really proud of that i've been married for 13 years i'm really proud of that happily married.

      "Okay. Occasion. Yes. And well thank you. Boston massachusetts. I moved to la about a year after graduating college in 2001. Quite often least a couple times a year. Battle of both cities they are polar opposite in many many ways but there's things about both of them that i love. To pursue acting and writing. It's still not complete reality to me but it was actually very easy because of the. The creative factor out here allowed me to pursue what i wanted to creatively and there's different the social culture with different in a way where from where i had grown up and it it suited me better my personality. I like the fact that you can come here and pursue any any niche of noon creativity or art or entertainment that you want to and sort of make your own path. I grew up where its nose constantly and is very very cold so. Sounds obvious but clearly i like that it's you can swim year-round and. I like that it's there's always something to do no matter what day of the week it is. I don't like well i miss my sam and miss that there's no i don't like that there's not a big family element here i miss i'm big family girl i miss my family feel like it's very crowded here but yet it's very easy to feel sort of isolated alone here. I can't see you she's but i do mostly just not up to much worldly travel mostly back to boston and. At florida where my parents live but i do enjoy traveling and took a lot of trips within california and around here. I'm just having a venture do something fun or if i'm gone homies nyc my family. I like to drive up to northern california go to san francisco and family and friends there. Always super super fun. in college i with my college boyfriend. Boston we drove we went to san francisco and drove down to la and las vegas and that was kind of how i realized i wanted to move here so that was very that was very i was big one. In general. I guess it would be moving here i move to when i move to la i got on a plane with didn't know anybody here and. I just got i talked to a girl that i met online and agreed to be her roommate and she pick me up at the airport. We never met and you know one of my dear friends to this day so definitely the deflate out here was. Is big monumental. Powerful and excited and just open to whatever. Citi communications got a lots of every lot of different writing writing styles eventually graduated with a concentration in public relations and english minor. Writing writing. Writer of legacy could say writer-actress which is i guess writing is first. Hard. Very hard because you need to know he's going to push you to do what you have to be self-starter you have to make it happen so it's very hard cuz i don't possess that naturally in my personality i do but not as much as i need to. I would say all going on in general. I sometimes take a walk listen ambient music helps if i need a soothing background white noise. Common common area and just. Just your basic deep breaths and just sort of take a minute to. To come back to it, mitchell place. Getting better. Good at controlling my temper. Cuz i don't usually. How to temper to often but when i do and i lose my cool i have a hard time controlling it. Yes. No. Argue with someone. I guess it was a friend. A friend a girlfriend. It wasn't it was about. Our. Are each separate perspectives on a. A certain situation between us. Obviously very very different and it started out as something big. And then we just realized this is. It's a stupid we don't need to be fighting about this so it kind of ended quickly. I guess it would have been with an ex-boyfriend fighting with an ex-boyfriend relationship stuff definitely losing my temper and making a situation escalated in a way that. It didn't need to be i wish that i had just walked away from it. I don't know if i could have avoided the complete situation but i definitely could have. Made the outcome much less. Chaotic. I guess that would be. Walking away from somebody who was definitely bad toxic from my life, but they really did want in my life and it was a true wrestling with morality and. Kinda sorta growing out like coming to a point where i have to say i'm not to do something that's. Really really hard for. Sort of being a short-term pain for long-term gain and. I had to make sort of an adult decision relationship-wise but it was still carried over into other areas of my life and taught me that. Feel great every decision is not always going to be easy and feel good. I was kind of forced to this issue was just what was going on in life was sort of can't ignore those signs just. I guess it would be a particular argument i had with somebody that happened to be. Inside of a public place and got in trouble for it i wish i could erase that. Mileage to my family have a wonderful family completely blast. Amazing parents. My brother has he has a little girls have a baby niece that i love more than anything in the world and i could not ask for a better family there. The idea. My parents for sure there's wonderful people and then stop by example and. I feel like i'm a good mix of both of them. Pretty easy i try lately it's been a little bit hard my sleeps been off but for the most part i've. Come to recognize the importance of it and it's it's been pretty easy. Lig fidgety maybe a little bit out of it i might might seem like i'm. In a good mood cuz i might be a little gideon. Laughing more just sort of. High emotions but overall get irritated faster and. Just sweat more just feel. Feel. Just a little off. Not really just. Try to be more focused. Get things done. I'm just trying to focus on what i want to do career-wise and really. Stop wasting time or you know. Procrastinating and get things done and being inspired going and seeing. You know being around people that are doing what i want to do and just carrying it over to my own life. No. No. Oh just a couple days i was just in with my family and my baby niece in florida and. That's why i went down there to see her so it was just awesome i'm always happy when i see her. Probably as very. Funny. Humor would definitely probably one of the first things they would say joking always a little. Wiseass and my personality but they would describe me as always at unconditional there for them and just. They know they know that i'm there if they need them always. My drive be more driven and getting things done. I guess it would be well a recent. A recent ex-boyfriend that was a mistake of a relationship. Yeah sort of just. I think because he the way he felt about himself certain things he would say and even though what he said didn't directly make me feel about the whole situation made me realize. Why the fact that i'm even with this person made me feel. Like i'm allowing people into my life it shouldn't be there so. I'm dumbing myself down and that was terrible. Yes i regret not listening to my gut instincts. Don't second-guess yourself. Great listener. Constant sense of humor. Very malleable in terms of people tolerant and comfortable around all.

I was like okay well this is the problem and i just wanted help because it just. When your mind is after you like that's like it's just awful to have your mind taking control of you like that. Yeah it's hard. Yeah yeah i definitely always thought i had a problem i was at something was like really wrong. I just always like kind of nervous around people like ye never can really like look anybody in the eye cuz i'm just so nervous my eyes are always kind of like racing and i. Would have sweats if i was in the situation that reminded me of the situation like i just try to avoid. What reminds me and brings those flashbacks. I've been feeling good i've been getting out more everyday i'm trying to. I guess walking keeps my mind off my ptsd symptoms so i'm trying to walk more. That helps. Yeah i have depression. It helps yeah it actually does help me alot my currently don't have one right now i'm actually getting a new one in a few days though like it's. Kind of a mix-up but yeah i really really helps me. I noticed that i've had less flashbacks and. I've. Been more relaxed vegas and. Yeah just you know trying to keep more occupied. Yeah. Really happy. I guess. I don't know. Today cuz i mean i'm glad to be part of this. I'm most proud of. Well. Traveling with ammo. I. Think i'm most proud of like the fact that i am. Able to you know not be like oh i mean most people i know they like deny that they have a problem and i'm proud that i can actually like. You know be a person who can realize okay i have a problem and i need help. But a lot of the people i know they don't take medication their untreated and. They just don't want to get any help and i'm glad to get help because i don't want to feel that way and i want to get help for the problem. Instead of feeling. Oh gosh is a lot i regret yeah there's a lot. I regret you know drug abuse you know but that's part of hino the ptsd i regret. A lot. Mistakes you know relationships stuff like that. Wow i would have told myself to. I guess the advice i would give myself was. 2. Try to keep my mind. More relaxed i guess. Yeah. A very nice person and i. Boys like to smile people are always saying hi smile a lot but the smile i guess it kind of hides like what's on the inside but you know i'm pretty depressed you know but. I just. Try to keep smiling and i always like to lend a hand to help and make. Will feel better. For fun i like to go to the mall that's a lot of fun i like to go to mama like to go out with my grandma. We go places go shopping i love shopping and. I like to go. Play like games like i like to play video. Stuff like that. Okay thanks. Goodbye. Okie dokie i'm gone. Oh okay. Thank you. \n",
      "Okay. Yes. I'm doing okay. I'm from greenwich connecticut. Yes. I will tear in 2008 so about 5 years ago. I try to go back at least once a year sometimes i go more sometimes less. Overall i think i like where i'm from better than la in general. I think that other than it being somewhere unfamiliar with. That type of people that are there. Are just more my. Typing what i'm used to and. Blessed superficial. Got here for college after i graduated high school and my mom and sister live in california. Initially it was easy because i felt like. It was a new experience so you kind of adapt and just. Are experiencing everything at once but then after the first few years when it really sets in. How different it is and. What life is out here it became more difficult than originally. Fine arts in photography. I was interested in photography since high school i did a lot of programs and. Got wards and things like that and publishment. So i decided to pursue art. Yes i have a fine arts degree that i got last year and. Yeah i really enjoy working or interning in forensics. I like that better than initially what i wanted to do was freelance photography. I feel like it's a more secure job and it's very interesting. Centrist in question. I guess just my childhood in general. Growing up. Walmart families very close. My extended family as well and they all most of them live. Within the area on the east coast in general so we would always do large family parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that. Yeah it is really fun and we trying all get together as much as possible which is. More difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different. States and countries. I consider myself more shy. What i'm feeling. What are you doing. I. Watch reality television i think it's kind of funny and lighthearted. Bravo tv like the real housewives shows and. Spike funny things that you don't really need to pay attention to. I'm good i guess i don't really have like a temper. Having. If i'm more stressed out it it definitely shows in my attitude but i don't to have like anger. Will me and my boyfriend like bicker all the time just like about like. Insignificant things. But other than that. I had an argument with my dad a few days ago. There's been like some tension going on. Since i went and visited over the holidays this past winter. Things about his girlfriend and. He thinks that i should be the one to make some kind of effort to. Have a relationship with her although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways. So for like the 30th time he. We were on the phone and he was. Telling me how i need to call her and speak to her and i told him that i was going to do it over this past weekend cuz of the jewish holidays and. He kind of was just like very mature and telling me all forget it she doesn't want to hear from you now and. I could care less because i. I don't care about having a relationship with her so she doesn't want to hear from me you know it's easier for me. I mean every time units in the same recurring argument a lot and i wish. That i could sometimes i do but i wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that i could just bite my tongue. But the thing is is that he says. Certain things that are untrue. Or thinks he knows that like will take me off. That are really nasty and. That he shouldn't be saying to me so he. So i kind of just like lose it and i can't really. Like not say anything. Well i guess the hardest decision i made which it didn't. Only realize that it's the hardest decision like looking back is once you decide where to after you graduate high school where to go to college because for me i've basically. Changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own. So it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time it felt like just like the progression of the next step but looking back now. That's probably one of the hardest decisions i made. I wish i could erase. The event or seeing. My grandmother's funeral which. Obviously it wouldn't change anything. But. It wasn't. Seeing her there was not something i'd want to. Like have in my memory. Come she was she was a very positive influence and always. Was not judgmental. And now i mean my parents are great role models just in general i mean they're very successful people. So whether or not we have like disagreements or that were separate people. They kind of are good role models in terms of what you want to have when you. Are older. Goodnight. Usually it's easy the problem is staying asleep. No matter how late i go to bed whether it's 10 p.m. or 4 a.m.. I will be up like clockwork. By 7:30 or 8 in the morning the latest every single day and i can't seem to. Figure out why i cannot stay asleep longer. No i just. In the morning i guess i'm a lighter sleeper but i just wake up like i just cannot stay asleep anymore which. Never used to be a problem this consistent but now it's. I cannot remember the last time i slept past 8:30 in the morning. I mean it just makes if i have to do stuff during the day and makes the walmart hiring. But it doesn't really i'm so used to it now it doesn't really change my mood it's just part of everyday. I don't know i kind of just feel very. Like so-so. Just. No extreme highs no extreme lows kind of. Onenote. Bland. I mean nothing like lately. Like recently it's just i would say over a. of years i kind of progressively become more. Seclusive and. Just reserved and. Not very outgoing. No. No i have been diagnosed with anxiety. I had some breathing problems. For a day or two and i had to go to the hospital. Cuz i thought it was more serious cuz i couldn't breathe but. They said that it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety. I think in the right setting and. The person who's doing it if they're open-minded and the therapist. Is helpful. And good at what they're doing then yeah. No i haven't been to therapy since i was a kid. I went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to like. Deal with whatever issues they were having with me. But it was never sunny we just sat around and talked about my day. Wasn't. I didn't feel like i needed therapy at the time so i didn't really get much out of it. I was happy when i was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the new year's holiday. But i'm there i can always just. We save up our money so it's a complete vacation i don't have to. Worry about paying bills i don't have to worry about. What i have to do tomorrow who i have to deal with i just every morning we wake up we. Hangout. Just enjoy the day. In general. I regret the college i chose to go to i didn't. Be from the east coast the whole collegiate system is setup a lot differently and. The university is out there and not the same as like the tight-knit california school system out here. So when i was researching colleges i kind of thought that santa monica college was just a general college just like boston college back home. Or. You know any other school with the name college at the end of it i didn't realize until you know the end of my first year even. That it was more like a transfer school like you. You can't i didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when i went. So kind of create created more problems for me. Well considering i'm 22 if probably 10 years ago. I would give myself the advice to. Probably stay closer to home. Intuitive. Really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to california. My best friend would describe me. Has a gray charismatic funny outgoing. Socially enjoyable person which is different than how. People who aren't my good friends would describe me. Which i mean i don't i mean it is what it is i. And very outgoing and and have a great time when i'm with my friend in my element but around strangers and in like uncomfortable groups and things i just. I am very shy and. Don't really. Speak much. Recently my friend was visiting and we went to a clippers basketball game a few weeks ago and i really enjoyed that. I'm very caring. I. I'm a very good judge of character. Which i mean i guess it's i mean i consider it to be a quality for myself. I'm various. I mean. Maria section and i'm more. I guess i guess so. Thanks. I can chat with you a little bit more about. \n",
      "Not go ahead and start it. Going to chat with you for a bit. When she's. Yes. Okay. One day move to l.a.. Moved here a long time ago to live to go to work. Well arizona and colorado. Don't.

They harass you all the time. So don't come out of the apartment. I didn't know when i move there that they were horrible people. So. And i've complained to management but they don't do anything about it. Just tell me to move. Yes. Back in the 90s. Crying all the time. Yeah. Oh yes yes. I was in the hospital. Two months ago for 15 days. I was in there for depression for arguing with. A person. That's not real. I nor the person want to hear them. It's not hard anymore it was before i was going to therapy. Help me be more cheerful anna. Ignore. Things that bother me. Sleeping all the time eating too much. Arguing screaming at this. Unreal person. Before i found out. No. Lately i've still been pretty depressed. Yes. Very hard. Well i wake up about every 2 hours to go to the bathroom and. Or something with some noise wakes me up. Do i don't sleep well.

I have two kids a girl and a boy. The kids. They're great. Are trying to get them to do the right thing. Trying to get them to stay in school. No. What you try to do the right thing and it doesn't always work out. Yes. But pretty close. I think about today's kids. They're just like any other kids. Kids are fine. Yes moving to the apartment i'm living in. Tom. Like i said i know. My second myself tonight 20 years ago. Stay away from my ex-husband. A positive influence. My daughter i think my daughter has. I'll because she's going to graduate from college and met. And so she's managed to stay in school and she has a child but she's trying to do the right things. Do you want to talk about anything else. Okay. Bye. During the building. Yes. \n",
      "And then i'm going to go ahead and put it under your arm just so you know. How long do i talk to her more. Okay. Okay. Yeah sure. I'm good how are you. I'm from florida originally. Where you from. For work. I haven't been back in like a few months. I don't know i guess it's like a smaller. Town been here. It was pretty easy. So it's not that much of a difference except my guess what buildings are bigger. I like the weather and. I like the environment of like. Hollywood i guess. I hate the transportation transportation system. And the traffic is really bad. Yeah i traveled a lot around america. I like like seeing new places and meeting new people from different areas and stuff. And i guess it just relaxing and it's fine. I went to canada once my. Mom is a friend up there so we went to visit her there. It's pretty cold. I didn't like that. About that particular trip. Or. I don't know if she. Meet us this week canadian food. I think it's poutine or something then. So i guess that means i was a new experience. I try to get out in the sun like go to the beach or something. I read a book. I'm pretty. Okay. Depends on how bad the situation is. I don't know like 2 days ago. I was arguing with my sister about something. Oh yeah i really don't remember it was something. Stupid i think she. I know she borrowed something from me and she didn't give it back on time. I don't know i guess. Maybe i wish i'd just wouldn't lose my temper so quickly. Sometimes. That isn't hyperbole often. I don't know i guess think more before i talk. And maybe i won't lose my temper. Trevan wish i could erase your memory. I don't know i guess just. Like god negative people. Or something or negative people i've met before. I guess i just want to race. The thought of meeting him. Well i. I like friends that we're just like. Not very good company in. They're just very. Not reagan influences so. Yeah i would just want to race meeting and i'm not friends with him anymore. My. Is it positive. My family. Taraji. And my friends now. So it's pretty good. I. Talk to them like i see them a lot. So. Hardest decision i've had to make. I don't know about. I guess. What i wanted to study in college baby. Start. hard but it's too little. Big decision. Computer science. Yeah a little bit not not as much but a little bit. Well i got into it it when i got into it when i was a teenager so. I guess i just. And i was going to ask so i just figured. I'm go on studying it fired at a higher level. Yeah somewhat but i. Kind of wanted to. Like the kind of trying to make a decision between. and like the arts. So. Yeah i'm stopping it in though. Dream job fashion designer. How hard is the job. I don't think it's a hard job i like clothes and fabric and making fools like that so i don't think it's a hard job. I fall asleep like within 5 minutes. Depending on how tired i am. I'm very irritable. Yeah i'm very irritable in. Not good to be around when i'm tired. And i can't focus. I've been feeling good fine. Thanks. No. No. No. The last time i felt really happy. I guess like. A week or so ago i went to. I went to. Running. I went to this event downtown. It was like a. Artwalk thing so it was exciting. Thanks. Oh just like different. Art galleries and stuff downtown. You're just exhibiting their working i don't know just interesting to walk around and see all that. I think i am. Generous. Patient. I think. I'm a good friend. I think i'm hard-working. And. What else. That's it. I wish i was more outgoing. Like more sociable person. And. I don't know and i wish i was like i guess not. Not easy to. Anger like temper something. Oh no not in trouble is just. Sometimes. Mount pleasant for people. Getting a temper. But i've never gone in trouble for. Really probably. I can't think of it. I guess. I was in. I was in a elevator one time and this person. Was running towards it. And make like i was trying to hold it for them. But i can reach in time they like started cursing me up so like i felt really bad cuz they probably thought i didn't try to open it for them. But. Yeah. It was. I'm tired gret not really want yeah i regret. Not. Contacting like. Old friends right now. So i guess maybe i'll do that in the future. I know them from like. Elementary school. Yeah but we lost contact for the years. Cuz i switch schools. For now. Okay. I don't know i guess i would just say. Learn as much as i can in. I don't know just. Don't hold back so much. I think i'm. Like not being. I'll going and stuff i guess i just told myself to be. Where i'm going. I think they'd say the same thing i said earlier that i'm generous. Patient. Hard-working. And. Spell stacy. Kind i hope they say that. I am proud of my intelligence. Okay. Okay bye. Tigger. Was it weird. \n",
      "You're just fine without. Your face and everything so. Yeah i bet it i think from this distance i think i better. Okay. Yes. Okay. From here from. From alhambra. The weather is really nice. And everything is very familiar. Sometimes there's too much congestion on the roads. Georgia traffic. I studied art and photography. I was so much as decision i just kept noticing that i was very interested in it. Yes. I'm a photographer. Oh. I supposed. Running a family portrait studio or. Some other type of photography business. I know not know i've been also department manager keeps me tied down. It's a fair it's not the greatest because of being in a department manager. I do have free rent but i have to stay. There a lot. That part does the refrigerant part is very good. Oh gosh. A most memorable experience. It's hard to say. Well. I mean there's good and bad memorable experiences. Elf. Well i guess something like sports success when i was in high school. There are a few things that i was happy about. Some art pieces i've made were memorable. And. Some bad things for me. My father's stats right now. Those are very memorable not good though. Call my parents and have a lot of brothers and sisters. My family. A fairly close. Most of them live around at la. There's a few that are from. Distant my brother lives in new york and. My other brother lives in maui. How mostly very talented. Just stem. More involved in technology then maybe i was. Or ham. And they are a. I think they're more of a hive mind and when i grow up. Seems like they were all hooked into. Social media. I'm going to walk or. Watch television. Carplay with my computer. Well. There's some. There's some kind of. Injustice has that happening. Not big deals but for example our parking situation got worse with some. New district parking. That's kind of upsetting. And this city doesn't seem to anna. I make any exceptions or change the brawls. And also some unfair things at work sometimes happened. That are. Cut that are upsetting. Oh yeah. I work in at a high sky worked at a high school dance. This last weekend. And when we arrived at the site. The people at the site said we couldn't set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things. At the location where we were assigned to do it. That we had to go outside. And then to get an okay to go inside because. Being outside we weren't prepared for noir. Told in advance that we were to be outside. It delayed our set-up time. And that does wouldn't have bothered me except that on monday morning the school car color bought some complained. That we were. Late setting up when it when they told us. To wait for them and we told them we would be delayed if we wait until we still get a complaint. So that that part is. Upsetting. And our work doesn't back us up. At the office they just need to place the school to maintain account so. How often that something like that happens it means they will. Not. Send you out to work at that school again which would translate into less payroll hours for the. The photographers that were on that job. That's yeah that's how they do things. So that that is upsetting. Most of the time that i dust off my resume and start looking for other. Situation center. That might be better. Yeah. A pretty good i usually. Might die in the moment i don't really. Lose it by later i might prevent or something like that. Went on the on the location i wouldn't do that. Well just today we have a tight schedule today and i have a friend that i'm. China car with today and we. We word arguing where to go first. 10 time so we compromised in. Did most of her things in one of my things then after. This was one of the things this over then we're going to do some of her things. Yeah. No. Post-traumatic stress syndrome is that what that is. No i have not. Yes. What's a 19. 80. Yeah i think believe it was 1980. Yeah. My father noticed some symptoms my father is. Pikes passed away but it was the psychiatrist. Well. I wasn't sleeping. I was laying around the house. Is waking up at. Noon sunday. And i didn't have a. Focusrite for. Getting a job it wasn't clear enough. I remember some. Job interviews that i've go to there. Front door then i wouldn't go in. And i think that was all. I'll part of. Depression. Yeah i thought i had a problem but i didn't know what it was. No. Well. And i went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that. He thought that i was done it but. And i did get too much better place i have to watch all the time. To see what's going on. With depression. Tell i think i. I'll have good days and bad days. I think therapy makes you. See what the. Like that i thought of it as a filter or wearing a. Asfer put on a depression pair of sunglasses you don't really. You see everything through that. So you have to. I have to sort of. Try to take the. Those glasses off for a little bit in. Double-check. Am i really. Perceiving these things accurately. Or am i seeing it through a depressed viewpoint. When i try to look. 4 clues about that. I think i am. Slipping back a little bit i don't do well during unemployed.. I've noticed in my path. And my past. And right now we have a work slowdown so it's easy to slip back into sleeping to later. Putting things off because the schedules too wide open for. For me for me personally as a depressed person i think that structure is really important. Dumb. Get you out of bed and you have to get somewhere in time and. Deal interact with people is those are all. Beneficial things for someone who's. Tents to be depressed. Well i don't know if it's changes us. A little bit i send to be focused on some things that are. Probably not that uplifting landscape. But it's more negative like i. I've been sort of thinking about how. Soldiers in the past. I don't know why they like the end during the roman era. Era or the ancient greeks how it would have been like to be in the. In a front-line battle with. I'm just kind of. My opinion crude weapons and no medical help and. I don't know i said my mind seems to go there a lot i'm just thinking about that and i've been looking at it and reading books about that or. Video clips on youtube. And things like that or. Kind of like terrible doom type things like. I was watching on that animal show. Crocodile attacks and things like that. We're probably shouldn't dwell so much on that. I'm in life in general yeah well. I think i regret not finishing college i think i had a. I think i would. I was going into depression right then it wasn't coping in my senior year very well. In. Didn't really. I didn't get out of. College with a degree. Cuz i was there seven years. So that's very that's a big regret that i have. I think it would have been to. At certain points i probably should have sought therapy. And also probably some. Hot outside. Help just with getting through finals just a logistics. I had i had was an art major and i had no car so. A lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth and. And also to. Meet at away locations i think it probably would have been worth it to. Do whatever it took to get a car at that time. So. Well i've been told i'm very patient. Also i have some original original artistic ideas. So. Those are. Those are good qualities very loyal and and also. And i support my friends. Fairly generous with them. It's a. I really enjoyed it was i had a. I had a nice experience so i just photographing them. A soccer game recently. Pet really enjoyed that so. Okay. It's my pleasure thank you goodbye. Ojeda. That's very interesting. \n",
      "Let you know. Okay how was. Okay thanks. Yes. I'm okay a little sleepy right now. I'm from new york. I wanted a. Change of environment and i want to start over somewhere. I'm about. 2 years ago. It took. A bit of a bit of adjustment so i'd say it was moderately difficult. I'm just getting used to the lifestyle different. Different pace different environment new people. I like the. The nightlife and it's kind of a cosmopolitan city. It's a little crowded sometimes and the traffic gets little hectic. Never. I'm a family my parents passed away and my family and i no longer keep in touch. So i. Pretty alone yeah. Sometimes yes. Just locally travel since i've been here. A change-of-pace new environment and. Relaxation. An escape room. Reality. I haven't. Traveled in a while but i've been moving around but i. A long time ago a study that i studied in paris and that was a fun time. Probably. This the schools meeting new people at the schools there. Yes i say yes most of the time. I don't know i've just i don't know why i'm like that i'm just over has always been more reserved. Pretty pretty good pretty controlled. When people are doing things that don't make any sense to me. I don't know when people seem to be deliberately trying to annoy me or. I can't be more specific right now i'm sorry. Usually try to work it out by myself somehow. I. Take walks and i do yoga. What do i do now. For a living or. I'm currently out of work i used to work for the county. See. Probably probably. Doing something creative that allows me to travel at the same time. I know. Yes. Mount. Maybe 10 years ago. Just feeling overwhelmed and anxious. About some things that have happened and. So i wanted to therapy for awhile. Yes. Yes. I've been more confident little more at ease with myself. Less anxious. Yes. Kind of. I guess sort of sort of depressed. Dinnerly. Feeling tired and sluggish and. Less less motivated and less interested in things. I yes. Can you tell. I guess easygoing and likes to have fun sometimes. I'm smart and innovative and like to try new things very open-minded person. Very tolerant. Music. Can i see movies any kind of adventure somewhere. I'd say yesterday solarmovie and i feel better. It was the james bond movie skyfall. I regret yes yeah. Be careful who you trust in life maybe. It doesn't. Doesn't seem like it right now. But possibly yes. It's a maybe. 10 years ago or so. Let's just the more carefree time. I had less stress less of a burden to myself. And i had a good group of friends. I felt more. More capable and more confident now thanks. I'd say. I can't think of anyone actually right now. Prince about money issues. Spending too much. Through school a long time ago. We just speak on the phone. We don't really see each other anymore. I'd say finishing grad school and finishing. Some. Training at us for seamanship maritime school. I had visual studies cinema studies. Yes. Thank you goodbye. \n",
      "Okay just wondering if she doesn't look like anything like the actual. Yeah like a virtual reality thing yeah. K. Okay. Oh and i'm done okay. Sure. Pretty good. New york. I moved to la in the 70s. But i asked you but i lived a lot of. Vices. I guess every few years but. I travel a lot so i've lived in. Evolution africa is lyft in spain switzerland hong kong 2. Different cultures food music rituals. Everything smells colors. Makes you feel alive. Excuse me. One of my trips. I lived in kenya for about a year i'd say. I love horseback riding so when you're. Viewing other animals when you're. Qatar disguise in the scent of a horseshoe can approach the animals. Lot closer so it was great. Single red orange ball sunsets in. Riding along you know. Seeing so many animals yeah. In kenya. Probably when i went to a. Messiah village and i happen to i used to live in hawaii. And i have adventure tahiti i know it's wearing one of those pearls that are. Hand-painted. I had it. Tide over the left shoulder with twisted in a knot and. I happen to. Enter a maasai village for the first time. That day and i looked all around and the men were wearing their clothing exactly what the same. Twist. On the same shoulder that came over to me and they said why are you dressed masai. And. And then they came back and gave me what appear to be. Sunbury lodge. What looks like beaded leather bookmarks but they were actually earrings and they would have like wade. My ears straight down and and then then gave me some bracelets. And then they had me wear something around my waist in the city now you look. Papa masai. So but i just i have lot of. I think. Living. Getting a chance to live in different countries around the world i would just you feel alive all your senses. I completely you know. Awoken. I think it's not so clear-cut i think a lot of people's are a hybrid of both i mean i think i can extreme lee shy sometimes. But extremely brazen and very courageous at other times probably one of my best virtue is is i'm very gutsy person so when i really. Feel passionate about something i risk everything to go. Achieve it sometimes i believe that. Usually i make decisions very quickly. And i find that i have a friend who makes decisions very slowly and he said to me tell me how i can make decisions quicker. And i told him i said well and that you should case you always have no choices when you mean doors. Hundreds of choices and i said not really because it's got wisest only one and it doesn't really matter you waste time physical energy emotional energy mental energy reflecting all of it when that wise you always know what the choice were you really want to do is and it doesn't matter whether there's a 98% chance of failure even if it's a 2% chance of success you have to go to the one that may yield you joy so i always go to that it's to be a waste of total time. And energy to even think about another choice cuz who cares if you remain unscathed but it wouldn't yields no joy. The pardon. You said you put your fish. What do i do when i'm annoyed. I don't want to annoy sometimes like. Is because sometimes i can have like it needs to be a little more patient. I guess you really have to put yourself. In somebody else's shoes rather than move the way you would react. Yes have more empathy. Not really i think that's the reason why i enjoy traveling so much cuz you're. Put another situations where you're forced to. 2. Understand other people's. Lives a lot more regardless of how different they are. From yours different situations i've been to so many third-world countries and. Lived in so many different situations that helps create that which is why. Travel is really the best education there is. Sync. Last time i argued about. Something. Go try to remember. Oh i see ghosts when somebody didn't respect ashley my privacy and something. Oh i know what it was. It was somebody who belong to the. Scientology faith. Inherited. I inherited possibly immune disorder from my mother my mother died from lupus. And. I sometimes even right now i have like skin rashes welts and everything and. I am very photos sensitive. And. I hadn't you know what episode where was i had a big flare up and i wasn't really feeling well i felt flushed and everything and. The scientologists tells me that i needed to be audited. And and he said something about are you aware of. Past lives and. I had told him that i was. Buddhist and i was kind of curious.. If you're going to try to recruit somebody to convert your religion at least you should find out. The other person what religion they are just to even be informed to be able to talk to them. And he said that are you aware of that. About something in your past and i go yes i believe that. Many religions including buddhism's and scientology believe that things that you have. Had it in your history sometimes a statue or things that you keep that anger issues bitterness. Resulting from even your past relationships or your parents and such can affect and make you even sick make you even have cancer yes we believe that and we also believe i said. That. You know that you had the power of each person has a godlike or buddha like nature to go ahead and you can make yourself. Even when i'm on the verge possibly and i probably get one cold. Maybe every 15 years i don't have a tendency to be sick at all and a large part of it as i think when i think i'm on the verge. I take. Sort of like i did this even when i was a child when i was seven i would. Fold out i have my boo boo and i would i would say i would have to good part. You know help the bad part of a simplistic way in terms of a child. And i would actually. Even when i was in a very severe car accident where i got cut by glass my whole back. I contracted healing and ends when i went back to the hospital. The doctors actually had the nurses come and say. This is incredible that. Two dudes hers last week or back was so severely cut. This is incredible healing thing so i believe that but. But i was just i think i annoyed and irritated because the scientologists told me that. Because he had taken 20 or 40 courses and he had the certificates on his wall. That he felt that he was more enlightened and it wasn't even a matter i said of whether he was. Will they took 2040 courses of whether i didn't frosting buddhism with it was for 5-10-15. 20 years weather of somebody been practicing some type of christianity for fifty years and then he's sitting in a church pew everyday doesn't mean person could have. Never attended church and beef more spiritual than somebody who has. You know. So i just was thinking that as the antithesis of. Somebody who says they were lighting but it's just the way i guess he kept grabbing his. You know his face down my throat that after while i was pretty patient with it but then who it was so pompous that i became irritated. Especially when he kept telling me that it was audited and yet the same person needed a hip surgery. The following week. And i didn't point it out because i just didn't want to get. Into it but. One could say hey you have a bad hip cuz you need to be audited that. Something that you did in your past otherwise you wouldn't need to get hip surgery i mean i believe to some extent things that can be caused by people themselves. And then he flippantly said while you where a scientologist believe that. Past lives could also affect. You know what i'm thinking to myself. Buddhist of all religions. Kind of like well known for being believing in in a cause-and-effect and past life situations and i found my thought. You should really read up if he's trying to convert other people from other religions so. But. You know why i just didn't you no care for the fact that he wouldn't drop it. But other than that i mean i don't. Sometimes to have a little more tact i guess when. In terms of patience. I can think of that right away i guess disconnecting my father when he was like a vegetable in the hospital. My brother. Was supposed to be the strong and supposedly because he. Is in the medical field so my sister and i says well you know he's the medical one so he's probably used to seeing this all the time. But it turns out he was the weakest one and even after. You know my boss my father kept me know. Bucking these body would actually. Be fighting the artificial respirator and what kind of things you see all this jerking of body movements and stuff it was just very hard. But you know it was after while the. You know even the physicians and even the pastor from that particular. You know what hospital they said that he was no longer like even if he was to. Awaken from that he did his brain function would have been you know legible. That was. I don't think i really have that many things that are that traumatic. That happened to me that i've. Had to blossom i really don't know what. It is within my makeup which. Doesn't make me feel like i need to like i don't keep the i have friends that. Have unmitigated issues which they're not even aware of. That affect their behavior or maybe their bitterness or their anger their hatred or their fear. And for some reason i feel blessed that i. Don't he like i can't really even think of something that. I mean i've had some. Bad situations happen to me but. It's not that the some reason they traumatized me. And affecting. You know my behavior where i would. Where i block it that i'm not aware. It's something or i hold residual. Negativity for some reason so. I really can't think of anything i mean. Does bad things that happen i know that they are but it's not like i feel like i was necessary for me to. Block them cuz i've been able to. You know. Chaps at sometimes they were unfortunate things that happened. Pretty easy i can usually make my sleep. sleep in any situation if i have a 1 hour flight to san francisco. I could just. Kind of. Lean against the window where the pillow has a blanket over and even on our flight passed out before the plane is even taking off from the ground so. I can have. Literally wanted had little sleep and i very at high-energy so i don't really need that much sleep but. Say like if i'm in africa and i. Bumpy potholes. Unpaved road and i still need side i need a few moments of sleep i'll just prop something up put my. Elbow against the window and say i think it'll take a nap for. 15 minutes go like this in through the jostling i could just take a nap for 15 minutes so. I don't really have that problem. Okay pretty okay me and i could deal without the skin flare-ups but you know from the photosensitivity and all that but other than that i'm pretty good spirits. Have i ever. Studyblr. I could still couldn't hear you i'm sorry. I've ever studied changes in my behavior was the word. Enough. I never just with friends and everything just even this past week just seeing friends that i enjoy being with and just. Having great meal laughing just having good time listening music. Regret about my entire life you man or are you talking about just recently or what are you talkin about. You know what's funny. I find that lot of the negative experiences that are in my life that have happened are falsely been. Opens up experiences that are. That are also great that i have not. Overlook trick sample i got totally ripped off by my business partner. To the tune of. My old my whole savings of had to start all over again. Sometimes people say to me like. Are you sure you're okay or are you just pretending to be okay or. Are you angry do you want to seek revenge if i was there cuz my business partner century ripped me off we knew each other's families which was even. More difficult in a way and. East all essentially my whole life savings essentially anyway and t what got sent to prison at the fbi was involved in her pulse involved. I was living in switzerland and my father was sick and i was going back and forth and. But you know if i hadn't get involved hadn't gotten involved with him in business. I wouldn't have had there a lot of rich experiences and i think sometimes the reason why. I don't know why i'm such a positive person but for some reason i'm able to his not that i'm purposely trying to i do see. The paws of destiny even harmful situations i wouldn't have gotten to live in barcelona and zurich i wouldn't have learned to speak as good spanish. Drummond. A lived-in. In europe if i had not got involved in business with my business partner end up ripping me off. But and there's a lot of other experiences a different friendships that i developed. During that period of time and in a way it was a totally different life. A different world that that would do you know that i would have never. Had the chance. You know to live through if i had not been filed from my. Course it cost me. Financially and but then again i've always been a type of person who. You know money isn't everything in. I think the one i least cared about money is when i made the most of it so. There you go. Principal what are my favorite. Times in my life probably when i lived in kenya. And you would think that. You know a lot of people have this. Really bad vision though maybe he's looking living. In mud dog huts or something and living very primitively i mean. It's not like that at all but i and you think that with the least amount of. Technological innovations and stuff like that i mean actually and i'd really didn't have. You know that much made many material goods to the time i mean i had the blast i had probably the one of the best. Years my life when i was living in kenya. The same thing that i did probably when i was about 15 or 16. 2. Live your life with passion. And again like shoes the way i was saying earlier about. Making decisions. You have to make decisions scott wise. What will. Give you a sense of on wonderment what will make you give you joy. And you have to b regardless what the percentage are even if you only have a 1% chance of success you have to go to sad cuz that's the only thing that will yield. You know the happiness in your life. The fact that i've a cure to that and been brazen whatever you want to say have the balls of cuts / like a harness to go ahead and. Fall my passions and i guess people called him somebody's strong decisions usually. Decisions that are when you where you remain unscathed usually don't heal joy that's just murphy's law office just the way it is. Sure. Hi. \n",
      "Okay. Yes. Pretty good. I grew up in boston. But 30 years ago. Yep. Not too often. Maybe once a year sometimes less. Oh i love living in that way i don't ever want to live anywhere else. Well i came out here to go to college and i wanted to be far away from my parents and. The weather was good and. That's part of it. Very easy. Well maybe. Somebody's at the beginning the first few weeks here it's really hard. To just be in a new environment and to be away from everybody i knew but after a few weeks. It was great. Broadcast journalism. Was something i'd wanted to do since i was 12. And everything i did from the time i was twelve until i went to college with sort of in pursuit of that dream. Nope. Well it's kind of a long story but i got laid off from my first job when i was. In my twenties and. It just. Once i done that work i realize that's not really what i wanted to do is to. Cutthroat of a business and it just really wasn't suited for me didn't make me happy. Yep. My dream job is working with football players and helping them recover from concussions and other injuries. Well the work itself is not very hard i'm very good at what i do the hard part is finding the right people and making the connections to work with them. I used to i don't travel so much right now. I love seeing different places and different things like i love going to places that are not like. Where i'm from. My favorite trip is i went to australia for my 30th birthday. Cuz i wanted to lose my 30th birthday as i cross the international date line. And i went to this really small. Place up on the west coast of australia. Card sharks payware native dolphins live and swim. And is very isolated for the most part. And i got to be there for a whole weekend just really just pretty much by myself. With all these wild dolphins and they come in they swim with you. And it's amazing. This is beautiful. Beautiful spot in the world. More shy. Why that's a good question. Partly the first thing i think of is cuz i've always been that way. But maybe that's an excuse under now. I just prefer to be quiet and i'd rather be with fewer people than lots of people. So. Room ceiling tile. What are you doing. I watch tv.. That's probably not the best alternative but it is something i do. And also walk on the beach cuz i live close to the beach so that's one of my favorite things to relax. Pretty good. It depends on the situation but most of the time i'm pretty good. I don't think i tend to argue with people i think i just get mad about situations. But not at people directly. If i feel guilty about anything at the moment. Not sure i have one at the moment. Noise. Other people's noise makes me really mad. I live across the street from a bar and these people are so rude and obnoxious and not considerate their neighbors that but just makes me really mad. Yeah. Well i'm only want the comes to mind of the top of my head is is when i bought my condo. It felt like a really hard decision at the time. You know i didn't know that i could do it i didn't wasn't sure if i had the money to do it. So. feel like a really difficult decision but in hindsight course it turned out to be a great decision. But at the time it was really difficult to do that. Pretty easy i sleep pretty well. For the most part good i'm i'm just really worried about money. At the moment so that's my biggest so i can't say that i'm like great. But it's cuz i'm worried but you know i'm also confident that things are going to work up. Nope. I don't know i can't remember. I mean i don't feel. Super happy all the time but i don't feel unhappy either sort of like just a. Even. Kiel. Well i got to go to the. My friends work at the motion picture academy so i get to see all the enough oscar nominated movies. She was there one night so i really enjoyed catching up with her and. Seeing her again so that was very pleasant. I think. They would say. Reliable. And. Well. And. Considerate and thoughtful. No. I really worked hard on that. I think. Lots of things maybe i would do differently but there's nothing that really i regret. Well i just think that there are things. That. Like it's not worth. Wasting the energy. To think about things that. I regret. So i don't have a lot of regrets about things. That's a good question. Don't worry about. The small stuff. And save more money. Well as soon as you know the normal things like i lose more weight than i would. Think be a little more fearless maybe. Be a little more. Bald. I don't think i have any of those. Send you a deal. Well i am self-employed so i work. All the time so my ideal weekend is having lots of clients. That's something i enjoy. So that would that would be ideal if this point my weekends if i were really busy. That i've really been able to take care of myself. And that you know i've done pretty much everything that i've said that i wanted to do. I've done that. And i don't mean i don't have regrets about things there's nothing really that. Is unfilled undone. In my life. Sure there's plenty of things i still want to do. But. I feel like i've done what i said i was going to do. Yeah that's not so great it's okay with my parents are deceased and i have a sister and a brother. I feel closer to my brother than my sister but. They both live in the east coast and i live in la. I'm in the know my sister has two girls. So i feel very close to my niece's so that we don't talk as much as we used to cook their teenager so. Have other things on their mind. Probably my teacher. Person i'd learned. My holistic bodywork from. I really like to. Model my work and my way of being after him. The keys are. A good role model. For me the way he holds his work in the way he lives his life. I'm pretty close we're not best friends but i do i know that i can call him anytime i need him. You like being with my friends or going out to dinner. Or. Yeah just spending time with my friends. Okay. Thanks. It works again. \n",

      "Yes. I'm doing good. Los angeles. Convenience. Convenience. People the crowd. Traffic. People that lack of respect. Locally regionally. Meeting old people i love talking old people. I work a lot with my elders and my reservation and other reservations here in california. And it's been a lot of time with her but the elders i talked with them and they helped me out a lot. Target are good stories. Going in the mountains and seeing waterfalls that no one else has seen except for my people. That was a most beautiful thing i think i found. It depends on the situation if i'm with somebody comes to me. Looking for me to help them i take control. If i need help with its i work at asking for help. So. It depends on the situation. Sometime. I garden. And i paint. Nice. How are you. Very glad. Three days ago it was about communication. There is that the lack of communication on the other person's part. And. I needed them to communicate better so that way i could understand. They didn't communicate so we had an argument. I got it settled. I felt caught off guard. Because this is the individual that i spend pretty much. Almost every minute of my day with and cannot be told what was going on in this person's head and then to have a situation arise. I was kept out i didn't like that. I'd rather pass. Probably lack of time spent with my grandparents. Grown up. Just wanted on you regret that you didn't miss time with spend time with him. I want thing i truly wish i could remember i was. I was a professional athlete and what time. I have party till like 4 in the morning and then i have did my event at like 10 in the morning. And. I was my captain and i embarrass my old team. That's one thing i truly believe that. As a professional fighter so yeah. party. about other people besides myself. I studied massage therapy and nursing degree. And lot of it's just been on job education. I'm very close. I'll get to my own injuries.

Sweetheart. A reflection of you. Play reflection of you. A mind you so much about yourself who you are. What's the hardest. Consistency. Here when you're sick being consistent. I don't assume my kids are right around. I listen to him first. I make my decisions after. I try not to come from an emotional. Heiting place. I think logically and i put myself in their place. Before i do it we discuss. We communicate heavy in my family. Because that's the only way we get along with each other through communication. Communicate. My family is severed pretty much so my family my relationship with my family. One reservation is very tight. The rest of the family were all fragmented and scattered around the southwest so it's not very tight at all. I have too many to count. Start with my uncle my uncle was like my dad. me a good way. He watched out for me he told me he taught me hard work at a very young age. He also taught me to protect my family. Tommy honor. Tommy love your superman. I don't lie ever had a good night sleep in years. I have get broken sleep. Idreams. Dreams do come true real. Get up and go to bathroom and go back to sleep. My years of fighting. Winchester. It got up to me. Reserved. Reserved and i try to find things to distract my brain to think of different ways of doing things. Well i got rid of tv about 8 months ago so i got rid of that distraction so what i do now is. Ada paint. Garden. Or cleaning house washing dishes. Galco walk that's nothing to do a lot of walking out is. Anxiety anxious. My anxieties. Hapax good i have. Techniques to bring myself down. Nothing new. Other than normal. Yes. 3 years ago around 3. Insomnia issues. It was about. 2 years ago around there to look it over two years ago i was released from therapy. The therapist release me. What i noticed. Is i still deal with pictures and emotions. But what i do is now i have. I really practice hard at. Taking care of myself and then. Getting to those places to things that. Strike me. Give me anxious or excited or angry. I learned how to. Work out of it and realize it's not real it's not real it's just the emotion it's not real so this other things like a little montresor tell myself. And this is really helped me alot from therapy because it's taught me that those emotions and pictures truly aren't real and so therapies helped a lot that mean it's just change my world yes. Around the same time as the ptsd. After years ago. You have to start. And my dreams when i dream i do. Last night. I just dreaming of fighting and then i'm preparing fighters to fight it wasn't nothing to i build a big xiety dreaming about preparing fighters to fight. Men stepping in front of thousands of people. And then i always end up fighting in my dreams. So it's always. What gets me scared and all my dreams is that. I should have made the move and finish the fight and i didn't. And so builds anxiety and stressing me that i tend to act out in my sleep. I was real like i was there. Freightliner smell taste feel everything their house there. This morning. Driving here. Talking to my girlfriend. Trustworthy. He loves me i love him he's more best friends. A02 change. I can recall. Regret. Just not spending time with my grandparents and in. I think day-to-day issues maybe you know a couple here there there. Should have went to the store first to something like that to me it's nothing like that. Quick-thinking know-it-all. My loyalty. My trustworthiness. Start new art project yesterday. Where is santa barbara new film some rocks and some old rocks some of that made by loving just do a dump vulgar rock out of the way and they're going through the pile of rocks and. I found the solrock that was in the middle of it. And i took a home and now i'm doing art piece on it. And for me it was like the thing was totally forgotten about was just considered a rock. And now that you'll be sitting in my grandkids stable it's just to me that's really cool. Like that. Start starting something. That. I'm so bad at. Then i don't think there's no way i can be good at it and all sudden i get. To be better at it through i don't even have to think about it just so good at it that way i can just touch it and feel it and then i think about it. These are things i'm proud of. I like that. Accomplishment i guess you can say. Right. Her her left clavicle needs adjustment and it's christian so you're off and it's drawing my attention to that so i don't know if you guys noticed that to the other part of it too is the hand motions as she does. Some of the hand motions are very aggressive and wakes it was very distracting in the beginning because she was like. Fast-moving like my therapist cuz we working with the ptsd issues he that he did everything slowly. Cuz i said off on quick trigger movement since i like with her hand movements like that coming out like this talkin it was distracting in the beginning but besides that everything is just like it's pretty amazing computer but it's. And you feel comfortable that it's a good thing it's a good thing. Yeah yeah. \n",
      "Virtual human. You for a bit okay okay. Okay. Yes. How do i find thank you. Originally i'm from well i was born in mississippi so i'm from gulfport mississippi. Yes. I didn't have a choice i was a child i moved here with my parents. When i was 2 years old. I was a toddler. Yeah if i like to travel and i travel a lot. Being around new environments and new people different things. Well one of my favorite trips was visiting africa. And i think 2000 fix i visited west africa that was a great trip for me it was a medical mission where we volunteered and. Give medical assistance to people. A friend of mine was actually involved and she talked to me about getting involved so i went with her and it went from there so i don't know made the decision that way. I am i am happy i did that it's something i'll never forget. I studied english and. Education so that i could teach high school students. Not currently no. Well right now i tutor privately for private tutoring company. And looking to get back into the classroom working as a teacher. Wow. Anything that combines teaching. Traveling and writing would be a dream job for me so. Anything that combines those three items so teaching has the closest i've come to that. Occasionally yes. I don't know i guess in comparison to others that are considered outgoing. And a lot of people have. That i seem reserved our kind of introverted. I don't know. Well. I don't know i read. I just started meditation. Try to breathe and calm down. Some things that make me really mad. Mistreatment of children. Abusive children. Try to figure out what's annoying me usually and then go from there if i can. Control not being annoyed by ultimately i control that whether or not i'm annoyed so try to figure out what the problem is and then go from there and not being if i can help it at all. No i'm fine. control tank at controlling my temper i think so i don't have. The last time i argue with someone. Was. I don't know maybe a couple of days ago and it was about. It was about a smell they had on their clothes but i thought smelled like perfume and they said and did not. I think i'm very close to my family. We're pretty close-knit family talk everyday see each other most everyday. There been a lot of positive influences in my life. I was saying my aunt and definitely my mother have all been positive influences. Well i'll look up to my aunt i think she's positive i look up to her. Because obviously we grew up with very similar backgrounds came from very similar neighborhoods and areas and she's very successful despite the types of things that we've gone through as children. And she doesn't let her past to find her future. My mom's. Overcome so many obstacles as well i'm she have some challenges with her health but she still. Tries to be optimistic and she still tries to. No overcome these things and just still live our life despite some physical barriers that she might have so i look up to people who are able to. No not allow their current situation to dictate their future because anything is possible. No i have not. No. I have. Well i was diagnosed. Within the last year and then again most recently within the last 3 months. Well. Fear and just not knowing what to do with some of the things i was feeling. And not annoying. You know why i couldn't stop feeling. The way i was feeling. There were a lot of symptoms on. You know mostly. Are you i gained a lot of weight. I couldn't sleep a lot. And then sometimes i could sleep too much. So sad sometimes. Like i wanted to cry a lot. Feeling okay. I'm more days. I mean to the alpha fine but like i said everything's differently and lately i've been feeling. More like i command them involved in my own life and like i want to get. Out and do more things. No no. No. Not any different from. Before what i was experiencing before. No. Well. I was receiving. I guess cycle therapy and. I don't know a lot of things happened i moved for a while to go take care of my grandmother and i just kind of. Got more involved and taking care of other people instead of myself for a while. Sometimes. I do. Yes it is. It's kind of difficult. I either have a hard time falling asleep or hard time staying asleep. I'm sure it is i just don't know what it is as of yet because i know. I usually inform thoughts continual thoughts running through my mind. Either keep me up or make it hard for me to go with sleep or make it hard for me to stay asleep. Internal sometimes that might help if i can write some things down and get it out that helps. Other than that i don't know. Haven't found any really great ways of coping. Tired. Mostly retired. Kind of confused. I don't know for the most part i feel happy it's just i'm. Last time i felt really happy or. I guess over the holidays. I don't know i guess just being around family and friends just the holiday season i guess in general happy time for me. And some people haven't seen in awhile. Talk about it. How my best friend is jaime probably as. Quiet sometimes. Cautious. Talkative sometimes. Tenacious. I don't know a lot of my friends say that they look up to me for some of my accomplishments and. They also say that they are grateful to have me as a friend because i'm carrying in. Compassion ever. Easy to talk to. That i remind him over. That's like a sister to them. Everyone has regrets i'm sure. Yeah i got some. Suggest. Relax and be yourself and just go ahead and it sounds cliche and i don't mean to sound that way but it's true is just we have to learn how to be comfortable with you and relax and just know you i'm to not compare yourself to other people. Because. What someone else is doing or where they may be in their life at a certain time is not necessarily where you are supposed to be or what you're supposed to be doing at that time it doesn't mean that you're. Left competent or less able to do it it just means that everyone has their path and everyone has their their time and their progression to how they get two things so i would tell. Me 10 years ago to just. Believe in me and stay on my own path for what it is that i want from my life. And don't be. I really enjoyed working with. Okay. A science project with my younger relatives my cousin's we did a science project together and that was fun despite the mess we made those ball. Being the first to attend college in my family. And then i'm going to college and coming back to the community where i went to school and then teaching and not community and volunteering in that community in helping youth or children that. Come from the same background that i came from so i'm most proud of being able to. Have the opportunity to improve and better myself and then to come back. And. Help someone else and proven better themselves as well. Goodbye. Hi. Really cool. \n",
      "Doorbell over here. Okay. Yes. I'm okay. I was born in san bernardino california. Yes. I'm staying with her sister in north hollywood. She makes it as comfortable as possible. I love the weather. And the entertainment. And the public transportation. It's very difficult to find full-time employment. And some of the people aren't as. Friendliest people from the south. Cuz i lived in the south before. Knossos only two things. No i don't. I was an english major in college. I haven't finished yes i am. I'd like to be a recording singer. Yes. I've always loved to sing from the time that i was a child. At times. When i'm alone i. I'm extremely. I guess i would say. Intermind it. Like i. Have a lot of thoughts and i keep them to myself. So. If i'm in that mode then i don't really. Interact with people but i can also interact with people if i. Change modes. I've just started doing yoga a couple of weeks ago. And. Last week on thursday. No on tuesday. Usually i. Just try to. Remain quiet. And listen to the situation if it's a person or if it's a. Situation. That i'm dealing with myself that's annoying. I try to think of alternate ways that. What. Make the situation better. Come up with alternate plans so i won't be annoyed. Pretty good. I may have had an argument. A few weeks ago. Just about timeliness. Like meeting on time and showing up on time. And it was actually last. Monday. No. To just be. Cautious of people's intentions. Pencil listen really well cuz people usually tell you what their intentions. Are without even. Realizing it. I'm a good listener. Patient. Fun-loving. Generous. Depressed sometimes. But generally. A good person. No i have not. Yes. Found within a year-and-a-half ago. I just knew that. I often thought about situations that. Happened in the past and. Kind of blame the situation for my future. Enough. Certain. Settings. Time if i. See certain types of individuals and certain settings it just reminds me. Up when i was younger when things happened. And changed my. Future plans. So i tried it. I used to just try to avoid. Those types of situations and certain types of people at that time. But now i feel like i. Just handle things better as far as. Being in the. Assembler settings with. Similar people i just. Handle those things better. I do. I'd like to believe that it does. I. Don't worry as much. It's just allowed me to. Know that. Actually speaking about the issues. Relieve me of the tension of. Holding them inside. So. That's how it's helped me. At first it was difficult just being open with. My internal emotions but now it. It actually is good because i know that. When things are occurring. If i'm. Able to communicate about them with a certain individual. It relieves me of the stress of. Of trying to figure out everything. Alone. And oftentimes by speaking about the issues. It allows me to. Come up with an alternative plan that may be better just because i'm hearing myself speak of the issue. I was diagnosed with depression then. My doctor felt that i should probably see the therapist. I am. It depends if i'm really. Busy during the week and have a lot of things to do. I often try to plan things and if i'm planning. Things it affects my sleep i might wake up in the middle of the night so. Sometimes it's easy and sometimes it isn't. Irritable. Just very irritable. I was feeling anxious. But now. Calmer. Today i don't but i have in the past week. Because i was. In the midst of searching for a. Star stable place to live. And. It was just taking so long to find a stable place to live so. I was becoming anxious. Thank you. Yes. Maybe in october. When my mother first came and she came to visit me in october and when she first got here we had a good time. The first couple of days so i was happy to see your i hadn't seen her in over a year. I'm proud that. I'm able to. Adjust to different situations. The older i've gotten the more. Adapt. The bowl i am in different environments in different situations. And. Learn how to be more resourceful. So. I'm proud of that. I'm sorry. My dad my sister she's positive cuz she's. Finished her master's degree. My mom sometime my best friend. Is very positive cuz she just started her new business two years ago and she's. Very enthusiastic about it so that's an inspiration. When someone lies consistently. I listened very very well sometimes. I. Give good advice. I'm a good friend i normally. Do the things that i say i'm going to do so i'm dependable. I communicate well. And. I. Enjoy. People's company most of the time especially if they're in good moods. Being around positive people. Music. Put me in a good mood. Comedy shows put me in a good mood. Good food puts me in a good mood. When i graduated from high school. It was a really i'll never forget it was wonderful day. Very confident accomplished and. I was extremely optimistic and hopeful for the future. You're welcome. Bye. \n",
      "Also she's liking to be counselor. And then i just press that. And then we just have that again and they're done. Call. Haikal. Guess. I'm actually i feel pretty good cuz i. I slept. All day yesterday almost are usually doing something if not work it's cool if it's not school. It's work and then social life and all that so i actually didn't have work yesterday and i don't have school. Alaska on the weekdays so i actually slept probably like. 85% of the days i actually feel kind of good but i'm actually kind of tired as well i have other stuff going on but other than that i'm good today. I'm originally from bakersfield california. Really. I'm so late when i was an infant and i'm left here when i was around 3 or 4. And i blame you i moved back here in 07 and i've been living here. Ever since. Wow since i've been here since 07 i've only been back maybe. Maybe like. Couple why were there for like a summer. Lichen. And i think i was there for like almost all summer but i don't even back up a couple times since i've been back here. Unfortunately. It compared to la it doesn't really compare. i grew up in sacramento actually i didn't get to tell you i was born in bakersfield then i lived here than anyways i don't know if i did i forgot anyways. Yeah there's like nothing really to do their truly smallest valley. La has all the stuff to do has. Oceans and ismael kinds of located. I'm by a lot of them cool places like vegas and. San diego and what have you not. But yeah other than that i miss my friends and stuff that i don't miss. Like actual city. I just missed some of the people that. I grew up with. I can't see your shoes but i don't travel actually i've only been out of california like six times. I would like to travel. I'm sorry. Have enough money to do so. I want to be a filmmaker. And what they still want to be a filmmaker and i. That i was tighter communications and the general at stuff too and 25 for your production classes and did a lot of stuff in regards to filmmaking. And i have learned a lot of stuff and i still have that knowledge however i haven't really used it since i've been back. Karen la i did all that stuff in northern california in sacramento. But and then i transfer switch over to be. At the business which i took some classes in that but now i'm actually studying to be optician and i'm actually almost done. What schooling and getting ready to try to get in sales and. Become an optician. So. But i do want to be i still want to be a filmmaker and that's still one of my plans. And i still actually i got into i'm playing poker 2 years ago and i really like the idea of becoming. Full-time filmmaker or full-time poker player have it both of those jobs are. Sterling difficult to make a living out of it have to be like the small percent so we'll see if not then. Hopefully my optician career could take me somewhere. Three oxygen. Oh. I guess i was just trying to find something that it was like it's like a trade is supposed to private college but it just like specifically. Trained you into one field and you just learned that you don't do like your ge. Are you going to class like you normally do for like. Like a. A major or whatever you're going to do so it just. Train judah civically to be auditioning and jump in the field i took it just because i actually want to be a dental assistant sound like something maybe i could do it sounds interesting but then the counselor actually. Got my attention to be optician so. I'm now trying to be an optician. And interesting. It's fine it's really hard but it's interesting in it. In-n-out. Let's fight has number wording. We want to benefit this far as like been able to help people see. Better and feel comfortable with glasses. Contact lenses whatever they feel. Like a what. I'm definitely not going however i can't decide. Sometimes like i'm kind of shy right now because. Talking to you and your. Computer engineer cartoon. Or animated. Whatever. So. But no usually 98%. I actually which is actually kind of funny and i think maybe. This might go for some of the poker players to. Really i've never really talked to any professional poker player to be as far as like. I actually playing poker is actually some of that. Helps me forget about anyting as far as like. Stuff in the past or present. Our future step is coming up as far as like i am really really really. Think about anything and just think about poker and it actually is kind of like a therapy. Thing for me cuz i don't like i guess you could say the kind of drug because i don't think about anyting. As far as ike. Stressed out or depressed r7000. The path. I just like focus on pogo so it's actually kind of relieving however playing poker is very stressful on top of that so i guess it's kind of like a. Catch 22 or whatever but. So no poker i put likes play basketball. I like to watch movies i to go to the beach actually one of the things i like to do is go to the beach cuz it does. It makes me feel good. But i usually go to the beach when it's hot. turn the. Cold season. That's coming up soon song. Looking forward to that i'm really busy but i'll try to go to the beach. I'm really good at controlling my temper actually i've only been in like. I'm 30 years old i've been in like six fights maybe and. All six of them were started by the other person. So i've never started a real fight in my whole life like i started fighting a little kid but. Talking about like real stuff like what you get past like 1314. But yeah i know i'm good like every now and then like this ben. Couple times maybe the password like i've. Wasn't able to control it. But as far as i ever being violent or anyting that's never occurred in everwood. But fair. Majority of the time yeah i don't have like. People do stupid things all the time and i just like let it go especially like that. On the freeway and stuff but. Oh i mean i get about with my ex girlfriend a lot but. I was just about really. Petty things i guess that maybe we just. I think we were good for each other but maybe some other lifetime because. We just bumped head too much so. Obviously she's my ex-girlfriend. Peifer reasons. We argued about. Girlfriend boyfriend day. I guess my film. There's a lot of stuff i got to handle this. Maybe like when i was doing really good when i was younger and i was working for. Production assistant for a filmmaker's around. I'm right live in sacramento so i was doing everything that i want to do as far as my dreams are concerned. Then i had a lot on my stuff together i had my own car mode apartment and then i got involved with like the wrong group of people i guess and. Kind of tumble downhill from there in like lost everything like our job apartment so i just wish that maybe i never got involved. Those kind of people that kind of girl. Ever. Because i would. Pee. my life is probably a lot different now however i believe that everything happens for a reason. And obviously i think you should also like stuff that happened good or bad. Learn from your mistakes so that when it happens again you can. Not make that mistake our try not to make it as bad. You know. I guess. Hardest decision. The hardest decision i have ever had to make. Would be. I guess you could say i don't really know. Can i say that. Maybe like my ex-girlfriend like i couldn't like. Stayed with her and i really liked still am in love with her and. Would like to be with her and miss her but i guess the biggest decision that i had to make was like i know that wasn't like a healthy relationship and. I know if we like stay together if we got married or had kids at. I don't think it would end up working out anyways so i guess the decision my hardest decision would be till like actually stay away from her and not get back with her. And. Be not with her so. I guess i was a hard really hard decision because. I could easily have done it and i guess maybe i would have been happier that way but. Stressed out and. Irritable or whatever and other way of having to deal with her i guess deal with each other our relationship so. It's really hard still is so i guess that's it. Not choosing to be with someone that i loved and love me. Whatever. What was that. I beg your pardon. Nevada. The first part of that question. Own event. Own event okay that can race. Event that i can erase for my. Imax girlfriend i wish. I never met her. My first. Girlfriend in my last girlfriend i wish i never met them cuz. We were we were together in love for a few years and then we broke up and it was really hard. So. I guess both of them. Extreme lazy i could fall asleep. Anywhere i actually the other day i broke a record i almost fell asleep standing up which would have been weird because i guess i would have. Falling down or something i don't know i just cut myself. I guess i was i mean i was really tired. I do a lot of stuff so it's hard for i don't really get that much sleep. As much as i would like. I can sleep when i'm dead or whatever. Have they said. I know. No. Lately i'm just tired but i'm alright i guess. Ideally with this breakup still it's only been like a month in a week. But it's actually it's not i'm going to pad worse things happened i mean worst things happen. Patterson captainsauce. Just. Wellman religious person that i'm catholic i believe in god i know there's a god so. I've obviously even though all of it even devoted. People tagada regardless of what they are. They are sometimes lose face so i do lose face sometimes but. Doesn't really last for that long and i know that there is a god and i know. That'll be okay and everything will be okay but you know it's hard. I'm dothan mike i don't really i just keep going and i go to school and work. And i just have to keep going i can't give up so i just. Tri-state busy and. Staying busy helps kind of in like sleeping. A lot house but i don't go to sleep a lot so. I don't know. Playing poker. Playing basketball. Houston jonathan knight. Hanging out my friends house me sometime. I felt really happy on friday because i'm. I went to san diego for the first time. And i didn't it wasn't as cool as i thought i wasn't be but we're like under circumstances as far as like my friend had business to take care of and it took a long time so. I would much rather been free during that time but i wasn't but we had fun it was cool i enjoyed it so yeah i really like that i was at fun and i was. Happy about going to san diego for the first time and i am. Had a good time. A lot of things but i guess i would say like. Be nicer till like. Family members note couple family members that i wish i would have been. Different to. Actor different to not that i was like a horrible but i could have been licensing. Insisted that if i didn't know the situation at hand. I would have never liked really went out and partied all the time like i did. Like high-school different part times of a device cartridges. Really focused on schooling and stuff and then. To the partying later wintergatan. Relationships that so just told myself more basely to be more. I'll have more direction be more focused i guess. Stay away from. People in unhealthy relationships. Unhealthy people i guess not that i'm the healthiest but. Yeah just what i've done a lot of stuff different but. I am i don't know if said earlier but i believe everything happens for a reason. So i guess everything's happening. Now for reason. Something keep going. I guess the few that i do have our. Two guys used to have cuz i have best friends now couple. I guess one new one. And i've lost a few best friends as far as like just not. We like what i own ways but i guess they're all probably describe me more as like. Energetic funny crazy. Allowed. Silly. Smart. I just i guess in general just like. Entertaining to be around. I haven't always been the best bestest best friend but. I tried you know my hardest. Selected. Call. Change myself. I wish i was. I wish i was like 15 pounds lighter. I wish i didn't need. How do i put this i feel like. I feel like i'm i feel like i. I need to be like in a relationship with a girl. I feel like i wish i didn't have to be. Like feel like. That i needed to have a girl all the time. In saugatuck help me like focus more. And i wish that like i didn't need. Sexual. I wasn't always think about sexual stuff. Towards girls all the time as far as like. Me having to be in a sexual. Being with them like. As far as like wanting sex as much as i do cuz i feel like. Concentrate our have to. Like be with girls are in race until like. Well i don't know how to say it but i was saying like there's like guy friends and i know that don't need sex as much as i do and i feel like i need it more than i feel like sometimes that i wish i didn't need as much so maybe i guess i'm addicted to it a little bit we're like i can focus on more things other than just. I mean i don't just focus on sex but i just feel like my focus on. I didn't want it need it i think i need it as much that. I could get more stuff done in my life. But. Yeah sometime i'm working on that. What am i most proud of. I'm most proud of. Almost i guess i guess i'm most proud of. Working for. Television station back in sacramento and working on a lot of them. Film sets cuz like i was 16 and i decided i want to be a filmmaker and then. Two years later or year-and-a-half later you basically i got i started making step to become a filmmaker and then i ended up. Working in the business and working as a filmmaker for a really. Really. Really. Good i'm cinematographer i really good i'm freelance photographer those that lives in sacramento that deal i think so i'm proud that i had a dream and i went for it and i actually ended up. To go towards my dream that were in my dream so. Yeah i guess that's one of my biggest. I'm congressman switch was like. Over 10 years ago but i know hopefully. Something like that could happen again soon. Perfect. Play. \n",
      "Never had it doesn't matter okay. Start a conversation. Okay. Okay gotcha. Sure. I'm doing good how are you. Chicago. Yeah. About 25 years ago. Yeah it's been awhile. Actually haven't been back i like that way. I like la. The big city so it's kind of similar but the weather is not the same so got to load la for the weather. Family house child. Took a little adjustment but not hard. The weather. Can't think of anything right off the bat but i sure wouldn't want to leave so my family is here so that's another reason why i wouldn't want to leave. Traffic. Not really but i've tried a couple little bit yeah. Seeing new places different people the way they live their lives. On my way into monterey california earlier. Flatware the middle of last year that was very nice. Ticket question. I'm not really sure. There's probably. I can't think of anything right off the bat which makes me think it's kind of weird but. Astronomy. Yeah it was. I don't know just kind of fell into it took a course liked it and took some more. I just went down that path. No. There is not much job opportunities. It's kind of limited. Yeah it does. My dream job. I would like to own. Erestaurant. A nice bar restaurant. Was like to have something a little more upscale than. Most places you go to. Released in the area that i live in most places don't seem very kind of just seemed like a dive bar just kind of. Worn-out run-down so something nice something different something creative. Some vibrant some 40 tracks the crowd. But it's probably costly so i don't know if it's really possible. I'm definitely more shy. But i can be outgoing when i'm comfortable with people that. Initially i'm pretty shy. Good idea. A lot of times. Try to just lay back and you do some deep breathing just kind of clear your mind. Or maybe just watch a movie listening to music is good reading a book. Pantages takes your mind away. Relax. I've gotten much better at it i used to have problems with that when i was younger but i'm good i'm good with that now. Learned that you shouldn't. React immediately to situations you should. You think before you speak that type of thing. My ex-girlfriend only broke up about 3 months ago. Where relationship just wasn't doing very well so it just kind of was going down a predictable path and we just were arguing over the same old stuff and. Wasn't really it wasn't a memorable argument that it was it was an argument. All i can think of and i haven't really seen her since so. That's what it is nothing special just a typical. Argument between two people who drowned separate. Frustrated. Like. Yeah i guess. Everybody kind of sees things in their own way and do you know my way in my perspective is right and i'm sure her way was right too so. Trying to convince somebody that. Yeah. Love your ideas or what you're thinking is more difficult than it is because everybody's kind of looking out for themselves. But yeah. That's a good example right there with the with my girlfriend i didn't have to i could have reacted a little differently and not shown so much emotion. There's been times in my life where i got into arguments with friends or something like that where. You know. Or previous relationships where i probably shouldn't have reacted the way i did you do not that i did anything bad but just more of a. You know be more mature about it and not me no reveal your emotions so much your. I think the thing. Leaving my first girlfriend to go to school when i was 18 is a long time ago. I went to school in san diego and i. Immediately wanted to come back so. I kind of ruined our relationship and we're still friends and i wish i didn't do that. I feel like i can contribute more to my family and my friends. I think i could do better i think i sell myself short so. Employment opportunities are hard to come by but if i can find a good job and be a lot more happy because i can provide for myself and others. So not be so much of a burden to people around me. Yeah real difficult. It's good. Very good. We're pretty open with each other and i see my mom and dad and my sister quite often so. It's good relation i mean we get along very well. Could be bunnies. Perfect but it's good. Pretty easy i'm a good sleeper. Probably irritable. It's harder to do tasks. It's kind of like you feel like you're being strained or something because you don't have as much energy and. Good. Relatively well springtime always makes everybody feel well. No not at all. Never. Really really heavy and you we all feel happy everyday at some point but really happy. Play been awhile. Probably super bowl sunday i was with all my friends we're having a good time so it's been probably like a month-and-a-half or something when i was really really happy. I wish i was more. I guess. Stuff to my goals and i wish i had better drive to succeed i don't know i usually settle for less. I don't know i guess that's. The calm demeanor part of me that's good and dad. Don't really matter i kind of live in the moment and then you kind of realize that 5-10 years ago on by. Should have done something. I'm just going to stick to that. Argument with my girlfriend 3 months ago she moved feel pretty bad. When i was. When i was in high school i got into an argument with a friend and. I drove. My car too fast and it was an area that i didn't know and i hit a turn that i didn't know was coming and i crashed my car so i wish i didn't do that. But that's a long time ago so it's not a big deal now. Stupid. Immature. My parents some of my close friends i have five a good group of three or four friends. Living positive influences. Caring guy. Nice person good heart. Little. Little unmotivated needs to improve on certain aspects of his life 2. Make himself better and. Passionate i guess passionate in a good amp. I care a lot and it's the same time. Sometimes i get the best of me. Sometimes you feel like you know you're doing more for your friends or somebody like that. You're doing more than. They deserve and you're not it's something reciprocated. So that's an example. Yeah probably but i can't think of anything off the top of my head. Focus more on school. Because while you're young you have the ability to multitask. And. I don't know. Really enjoyed i mean i do things everyday that i enjoy but really enjoyed i don't know. I cleaned up a bunch of stuff in my room so it's nice to shed some old garbage so that that was all right but don't know if i really enjoyed that. I feel content after it. How much. It's kind of sad i don't know. I think i could do better i feel like i'm underachievers so not much i don't know. Very detail-oriented organized. I like to finish tasks. I care a lot young very caring. I have good intentions in mind i don't like two wrong people i don't like to lie because once you buy one lie leads to another so i don't like that. But yeah. About it. Cool. Right on have a good day. A. Those weird if i like i wasn't therapy. So take this offer. \n",
      "And then when she's done. Yes. Good thank you. El segundo right down the street. The beach. The smog. I tried to when i have time. Being away from home getting away. I recently went to palm springs with my wife and my friends and it was really nice is 100° outside and we lay by the pool and barbecued. I'm not sure probably graduating from college maybe. First person in my family to graduate i guess from college so it's kind of a big deal. Advertising communications and public relations. Well i have. In junior college i did communications a lot of public speaking classes so. I went on and transfer to university and. Wanted to say the same thing i guess. Yeah i work in advertising now. Dream job. To work for a. A big golf company. And do their advertising for them. I definitely not shy maybe. Might seem like it ran out just cuz i'm not this is a different. A new setting but usually outgoing. What are you doing. I like to go to the gym i think. I like to run and be outdoors i surf a lot. So anytime i'm stressed i definitely just. Try to go to the gym or. Wake up earlier and shirt before work. I don't really have a temper i just i'm pretty mellow. Haven't really argued with anyone we have disagreements you know with family members or friends but. Usually i solved right then and there. I'm not sure. Maybe not. Providing for my family as much as i'd like to i guess. I'm not sure off the top of my head. Pretty good we're all pretty close dad mom sisters brothers wife. In-laws. Siblings are you everyone pets. Probably my dad. He's a he's a hard worker. And i kind of transmitted. Do the same thing be the same way. That's one thing i struggle with i definitely. Get a good night's sleep but it's hard to go to sleep. Just over the years. Sleep-deprived in some. Little bit of insomnia i mean it's getting better now i'm getting older. I'm trying to train my body to go to bed around 1 but when i was younger was 234 in the morning. I feel okay. Happy. I'm in a little bit right now just because. My my wife is pregnant so i'm slowly feeling a little bit the the side effects i guess. Yeah like i mean i feel a little a little down here and there but at the same time i'd like i said i just go to the gym or go for a longer run you know cuz she's healthy we're healthy and everything's good and all that but. Supposedly you got the man pregnancy side-effects it's our first so i'm unfamiliar with the feelings. This morning when i when i woke up. Have nots. I got to get together with a couple of my friends and play around of golf enjoy the sunshine nice day. As outgoing and. Hard-working and. Good family person. Maybe just. Have a little bit more confidence. Yeah. I don't recall. Not really i try not to have any regrets just move forward from something. Negative i guess. Trying to move on. To go to school stay in school. Invest investor lee start a 401k early. All that the other things you know start a retirement fund. Holly buff. Just dom. Being raised by good family and.

      "Turn up. Yes. Spectacular this is an interesting experiment. I am from middle of nowhere iowa. May 2nd of 2007. So exactly 5 years ago 6 years ago. Infrequently like once every couple years. The weather exist so it's more extreme and then. Rudderless. Exciting. That was colorful. Winter in minnesota. I took approximately. The drive-in that's that's about all it took. The lights. The lights to care the rest. I really love that it's a giant concrete playground at night time so that bicycles. Have free rein to the streets i like all the art i love. The fact that there's so many different kinds of culture jammed all together and then if you look hard enough you can find anything you really want here. Oh you know. The traffic. The exceedingly high cost of living. Yes those are those are my big beefs. Not nearly as much as i would like to. What's on a little bit. I like not. Knowing exactly how things are going to go like the fact that it forces me to. Deal with people too. Deal with situations in ways that i normally wouldn't have to. Last year i got to. Hangout in san marcos for a little bit. After i split up with my ex. And then. After san marcos went back to iowa for a bunch of family stuff and then i brought my little brother to los angeles. Last week managed to go on a bike ride for ciclavia. As i was basically a rolling green light the entire way down venice boulevard and so he made me made a bunch of like national news and is all over the place but the rest of us as his support group riding around on topics and stuff they we didn't. About and i we didn't blink because those normal fry friends that wasn't even the most absurd thing he's done lately i was just at a happy normal sunday but. Our group of friends. Is so unusual that a normal sunday for us is extreme for everyone else. I used to be an introvert but definitely an extra birth last few years thank you los angeles. Once. I found the right group of friends. It was easy to be social it. Drew me to be social. Extraverted even outgoing. Bombastic for the first time and it stuck. What are you doing. If i weren't already the most relaxed guy already i would probably do things but when i'm really stressed out i do all sorts of stuff. Usually i tried to enlist my friends to help me doing art project. What temper. Panics cuz i really wanted to make him not hate me. And that mostly failed. Hard on him. I mostly you must have got by with. I will scrapes on my hugo. When. When that all went down i tried to talk to him but i got distracted for the very first time that day and so instead of. Having my. Purple gloves up i managed to. Take a whole bunch of words to the side of the head and fall over trash can it was. Not my most graceful moment. I feel guilty about lots of stuff. Feel guilty about eating more often than anything else. Cuz i really love junk food is really good and i have very little food will power used to be that guy. Not sure what the hardest decision i ever had to make was. Middle lot of hard decisions. I guess. 3 huntley los angeles after my ex and my best friend did a whole bunch of nasty stuff. But. I wasn't even that hard cuz it pushed me to do it so. Freaky questions. Do you know broken collarbone. Severe pain get surgery on it all seems like it made sense at the time. No. Members are important i have loved a spoiled blessed life and if i changed anything then it wouldn't be the same universe i like this universe. Little brother lives here he's awesome he's actually right outside waiting for me. My mom is crazy and my dad is crazy everyone else is crazy i'm pretty crazy. But. Since most of the rest of them live so far away. Relationship is positive and sparse. Jack has been a pretty positive influence on my lately. She is a magical creature. Well there's a part where she's intensely physically beautiful. Is the part where she. Manages to. Hit me with the. Best inspiration words that is the part where she. Actually works on the exact things that make me excited there's the part where she pops in and out of my life at the exact right instance and then there's the part. Where. She is 100-percent kind and caring. All the time. All of those things are really nice but then when you add to that and compound it with the fact that. She does this all. Without wanting anything in return. Smitten. What a funny question how do i know them as though she's multiple people how did you know. I know her through my. Bicycle friends. The hard part is going to bed but as soon as i get. To to sleep land i'm pretty much there until an earthquake hits. So. I get to sleep. Poorly but then i'm a pro at it so doesn't matter. Less verbose and that's about it my dark circles get slightly larger and i'm pretty much the exact same dude because i've been doing it most of my life. So stoked that i might as well be on fire. Because. The universe. And it's infant. I suppose the word is sardonic sense of humor. Has managed to convince me of the. Reality of magic. In the arthur c clarke's diamonds so. As a fortunate and vaguely aware being. It's my privilege to get to enjoy more time like this. Yeah. My excitement is increasing at an almost exponential rate and feeling more and more inspired all the time. If i can just work on the motivation. Poseidon. Not since you asked me on the phone a little while ago now. I know i used to think i had it but who knows at this point those while ago. I was very unhappy with most of my life for a very long time and then i moved to los angeles and. Started having fun and then now the rest is ancient history. Tell me about. 2013. Working on my shoes this morning was really nice. Doodling. Our project that all my friends. Help him put on that's that was pretty nice it's a nice feeling. I'm a very good question i'm not actually sure. Awesome later today though. I guess i'm. Enthusiastic. I am. Historic. And i am. I'm going to have to say. Highly analytical. Be nice if. I could get my superpowers back that'd be pretty cool. Like turning on some of the fancier finally. Tuned and delicate machinery that chinese medicine has clued me into inside myself. Complete f1. I think the thing that i must proud of. Would probably. Be. I'm not actually sure. All sorts of stuff i'm working on that. Don't masturbate so much. Jackrabbit really bad puns and dessert. Some problem. Paielli. Okay. What are who. \n",
      "Thank you. Yes. I'm doing well thank you. From los angeles. Sports outdoor sports mainly. Surfing snowboarding mountain biking rock climbing. Traffic. Yes. Experiencing different cultures. Well i love going to mexico. And. It's so much different from california and western culture so to speak i know mexico's a western civilization but. The the level of. Entertainment and the level of education is so much different that they're like two different worlds. Traveling you mean. I would have to say going to an island off the coast of fiji and the name is tavarua. And it's a very small island you can walk around in 30 minutes 30 or 40 minutes. And that's a place where you go to go surfing and it is an incredible. Visually incredible and experientially incredible place. I study biology. I was pushed from behind by my father who was a medical doctor and he wanted me to become a medical doctor also. Not at all i'm working in. Areas of business now. Yes i am. My dream job would be to be a missionary. Yes. My father's. Initial objective when he became an md was to become a missionary and the he's a very. Generous person and i think i am too i guess i got that from him hereditarily. But i would like to help people. And i don't think being a doctor is helping people i really don't i think it's disingenuous to say you're helping people while you're stuffing wads of cash into your pocket. I would like to be. Building people homes and helping them find freshwater sources things like that if i could afford to travel. To promote places like that. What are you doing. My exercise. I think i'm pretty good at it. I think i'm pretty effective at it. It was probably two days ago it was my girlfriend. And it was about her. Lack of consideration. I felt frustrated. A situation which. I wished i could handle differently. In my later years i would say i don't have many regrets in my younger years i used to. Be snubbed by people and i would keep my mouth shut and i wouldn't say anything i would not express my displeasure of there. Actions or their behavior i would just keep my mouth closed and internalized my feelings i've learned that that. Is so wrong. And so. In window probably the last 15 to 20 years i have made it a point to vocalize my. Displeasure with someone's actions right away and that. Takes care of the anger. Immediately. Yes it depends what you mean by trouble i think. All the way around once you take the beanie the beginning to the end. Diffuses trouble rather than. Prolongs or protracts the trouble. Going back it would be to not to pursue medicine like my father wanted we argued. At length. For many. Months and years about this and finally i prevailed and i didn't go to i didn't go that route but that was probably the most. Difficult.. In my life. There was a time when i wished i could erase a female interactions girlfriends than and their. Betrayals but now i realized it. Keeping those memories make me who i am today and. And dealing with them defines who i am today. All my parents are deceased i had very good relationships with my parents i'm very thankful for that. Even though my father was somewhat of a. Hard handed. Draconian person. We came to an understanding well before he died. And my brothers i get along great with my younger brother. But my older brother has issues he has psychological issues and. They continue to plague him and to effect. Me also just. Just knowing that he's going through turmoil. Well i guess i really don't cope with it because. He's clinically depressed. And he has suicidal tendencies. And that he's not working he's very highly educated. And he doesn't talk to me. And his family is very abusive towards him it's an i'm not out of happy relationship for his family. Yes. I know i would have to say my father my father is my hero he's my model. He's my archetype for what a man should be he's use unimpeachably honest. And kind. Yet on the other hand he was. He had high expectations of me and my two brothers. Usually i wants my head hits the pillow i am dead asleep like a log but lately i've been having just last night i couldn't sleep i woke up at 2. And i have a feeling it's because of a diagnosis of cancer that i received one month ago. With my own personal methods of handling stress. I am okay i'm probably 90% okay. That 10% comes from. Insured miss about the future. About weather. I will survive this or not. Not really. No. Never. Never. Oh i was either surfing or snowboarding. Or rock climbing or mountain biking i always experience joy when i'm exercising at a very high level of exertion. Funny jovial. Intelligent perfectionist. That's no one's asked me much about that. Maybe. To submerge my. Hedonistic self. I look at once again and my father fills my consciousness he was the ultimate. Defer of gratification. He. Put. Now behind him and he put what will be in the future. In his sights and he never let go of that and that's what made him the self-made man that he was. Whereas i am looking always for the present. How i feel now and it's difficult for me to. Slog through a mile full of crap in order to get to a prize that is so far away. It would be. My ex-boss. And he started using my last day of work when he fired me he started using. A lot of profanity toward me and i turned to him and i said you cannot talk to me that way. And he continue to use more profanity. Until. I objected to it again and that's when he fired me and. That's still in my mind and that occurred. A year-and-a-half ago. Anything i regret oh yeah i regret not getting married and having kids. Sure i suppose i could but i think that. That would have robbed me of the many opportunities i had. And i took to travel around the world and experience different cultures because. That's what i enjoy the most about life is exploring and seeing different things and talking to different people and expanding my awareness. Because the united states is not the end of the world it is once you get to travel you find out that we are not. If we do not have the highest. A level of. Of living in the whole world than other people think that we're the only ones that think that and i disagree. That's a good one. I would say i would say to just enjoy life because you never know when it's going to end and i think i've done that. And i may be coming to an end soon with this diagnosis of cancer so. I think i've done i'm happy with my life thus far. I. Was giving a. Rock climbing lesson i have a part-time job of instructing rock climbing. And many of these people have never done it before. And they thanked me and they told me what a great time they had and how this may have changed their lives so. That was very gratifying to me. I would say. My. Devotion to. The environment. I wasn't always an environmentalist but. I have been vocal in the cause of. Being a. A steward. Of the environment because today there are a lot of people people that are. Polluting the environment with a lot of chemicals and pollutants septic things like that and. I stand up and i have been on tv and on youtube speaking up against these people that pollute the environment. You're welcome. Goodbye. That was interesting. \n",
      "Yeah. I'm okay. Burbank california. Yeah. The weather of course i think everyone likes the weather. It's not too. City like chicago or new york. Big enough we have beaches are not landlocked. Sometimes the smog. The traffic. The fact that i've just been here like my entire life almost. Not enough as i'd like to i go to school in chicago and i've been to new york a couple times. San francisco and i took a road trip across the country. That was cool. I saw a couple states. See new places. Going to. Landmarks that i've only. Read about her seeing pictures of. I traveled from los angeles to chicago taking route 66. And the best part was seeing the grand canyon for the first time. It was. The coolest thing i've ever seen probably. Happy. And then happy was. Was beautiful it was nice. I haven't felt like that in a long time. I'm studying film. It's just. Something i've always loved for as long as i could remember and when it came time to start. Applying to schools i wasn't sure what i wanted to do. And. I applied to northwestern as a film student. And it just ended up being the right decision. I love making movies. But part of me really loves. Making people laugh and being in front of the camera. So. Comedian a comedic actor would be. Totally great but. That's hard. Super outgoing and i love talking to people a lot i like i like being the center of attention. Usually. I. I like to watch mindless television. Like. Toddlers & tiaras and. Duck dynasty. Tv programs were really don't have to pay attention at all. I'm okay at it. Get really. Emotionally fast. But i. I'm usually. Able to. To keep my anger down and not like lash out at others and stuff. The most part. Sometimes. I get into like arguments and fights with my friends and people who are important to me really easily. And i hate apologizing to people so besides could last pretty long. My best friend ryan i think. It was about. Our relationship. How we kind of messed it up and crossed some lines and. Where how we were going to go back to the way it was before. Really hard. It's um. He's my best friend and i miss him. But. We messed up and this is just not the same. It's like not the same friendship. Me too. Too many. I guess. When i have a boyfriend and he is a girlfriend. It's not okay. I wish i would have just. Realize that this was bad. And just. Would have stopped there and not have let it continued for weeks which led to my breakup. And then our friendship being really messed up. I guess not spend as much time with him as i did. Be more assertive. I guess. It was. In november. I was very depressed. And suicidal. So i told my friend. What i was feeling. And that she needed to take me to the er. From the er i had the choice to. I don't know i guess. Go homer gets sent to a mental hospital. And even though i felt like i didn't have a choice i knew it was my choice and i. Decided to go to the mental hospital which is like the worst experience of my life ever. It was. Awful. It was in chicago and. It. Was. Scary. I didn't know anyone and they just like take all your stuff and they put you in some scrubs and they just. Start giving you medication and you're basically left your own devices they were only like 3 group therapy sessions a day and everyone there was. Mostly men and they were all really old. And. It was scary i didn't know anyone everyone most of the people there weren't depressed they were. Violent. So that was pretty scary and i just dumb. It was really hard for me. I had been so depressed. For like a month i stopped going to my classes and work and i told my teachers lies. About being sick. And i just kept calling in sick to work. I dropped a class and i was failing my classes and not turned in any work and. I wasn't talking to any of my friends and. I was. Drinking a lot and passing out and vomiting everywhere and. I was just in a really bad place. And when i finally was going to kill myself i realized i needed help. It was. I had severe depression when i was a younger teenager. And i tried to kill myself then. And i'll start putting therapy for quite some time. So. I figured i don't want to go down. But bad path again. I just want to get better. So i had to do it i had to get help. I do i go once a week. I feel like if you have the right therapist. It's really useful. I had one therapist that i really like. And i thought we could have. Gone really far but. Sadly she's back in chicago and i'm in los angeles so i have to. Have to make do with this new therapist. She's okay. Did not. We're not. That great together but she's who i have right now. Better than nothing. Not that easy at all. Ever since. I got out of the hospital and start. Anaya beacon medication. For my depression. Is having been able to sleep well. Falling asleep is hard staying asleep is hired. Have really. Crazy vivid dreams that wake me up in our disturbing. I guess just. Sometimes they reflect. Things that i'm worried about. Are happening in my life but they're just. They're scary and they seem so real that sometimes i wake up and i have to ask my mom like did we go here to be do this to this really happen. And it's usually know you drink that. Sometimes i've gotten so scared i like talk in my sleep and wake myself up. Probably like two nights ago. That is a. Hard question. I think. In november. After i got. Out of the hospital. I finally had one good day. And my friend took me into. Downtown chicago. And we went to the sears tower. And got to look. Over those like big windows that you walk out on and see the city. That was for the cool. Probably. Super outgoing likes to be the center of attention. Funny and a little bit crazy. I try not to regret things. In my life. I would say that. Living is worth it. And just don't be afraid to ask for help. When you need it don't wait until it gets really bad. I guess my ideal weekend would be. Sleeping in. Eminem. Catching a movie with my friends. Baby going home with them and. Baked some cookies eat all the cookies. Watch some tv have a sleepover. And then like make. Pancakes in the morning and watch more movies we watch a lot of movies i would like to do my freed. Go for a walk i don't know go to the beach. That is a hard question. I mean i think i've. Done a lot of great things. In my life. And. I have achieved a lot. But. I think one of the proudest things. Proudest moments in my life is something. Really small and insignificant. I was doing this. Exercise boot camp and. The last persons like cross the finish line had to do like. 30 push-ups. And. It was some guy i didn't really know him at all and the trainer said does anyone want to help him if you don't want to help them you have to do half each. And no one wanted to help him and then i just decided to start doing push-ups with him. And i just. It wasn't cuz i wanted to get. Creditor because i thought it would make me look good i just. Normally not about that but it just. I feel really good about that. Is my. Bye. Button. \n",

Was told i'm a part-time member in this band and i was told that. You know i wasn't officially in the car group and stuff i feel pretty bad about that for a few days. In life. Maybe going maybe finishing college that might be something. Not. Turn out just never. I never came to pass that i would transfer to the four-year university and get a bachelor's degree. Best qualities i think generally that easygoing this and. Good sense of humor. Recently that i really enjoyed last weekend i went camping on a beach with. How about your friends that was nice. Was proud of. I guess you do musical accomplishments i put a lot of work into that and i'm finding success in my way. Thank you. Ikea's interesting goodbye. At this button. Very interesting. \n",
      "Okay. Thank you. Hi. Yes. I'm okay doing a little tired and. Worried. I'm looking for a place to live. I don't have a job right now so. Things are. He's a little. Shaky for me. I'm staying with my son in venice. It's pretty good but both of us need to have our own space so that's why i'm looking for another place to live. Originally from new york but i. Been in california since the early 70s. Yeah. Because i had been living in portland oregon and i was getting tired of the weather up there and my son was down here so it seems like a good place to be. To hard day i met people right away and. I just really like it here so it was it was easy to connect with people. The weather is number one for most people i love being near the ocean. I like the energy i like if they are like the artistic culture. Well everybody loves the traffic emily loves the weather and hates the traffic so i kind of feel the same way. Sometimes it. Tickets a little wearing that it's so busy and the fact that it's so expensive makes it difficult. I know not as much as i'd like if if i had more more income more funds i would. Travel more. May i travel as let's say so my longest trip sit. Was out of the country was to mexico and i traveled. Drove down with a friend down to oaxaca. And the whole trip we took about. Took us about 4 weeks going down and back from the bay area. That was a fun trip. Well we've been working together on the census and she had made that trip a few times and invited me to come along with her. From that trip i would say we were in oaxaca for a day of the dead. So it was celebrating day of the dead with the family in the little village that we were staying in. Everybody in the village. Makes an altar in their house. Heifer there. I loved ones who have passed away. And. They also decorate clean and decorate the graves. So there were lots of flowers and it was just it was neat to be there and be with. Bat family celebrating that. In the liberal arts program but i didn't stay stay only stay in school for in college for a couple years. But i was most interested in liberal arts and humanities. My dream job would be personal assisting somebody who. Was in a creative field. And getting to travel and go to events with them. It's hard to break into starting now very minimally with somebody who i'm doing more of a. Volunteer. Work with and i'm i'm working on. Building up some of my skills so that i can be doing more of that. I'm fairly i'm kind of a friendly introvert so. And i've no trouble meeting people i don't hold back and. And i just am not like shy at parties i'll go up and talk to people. But i am over all kind of introverted so. I prefer one-on-one. Then. Big groups. I know it's not hawaii. What are you doing. I like to watch i like to watch improvement shows like a hgtv i like to watch. Agree model shows and and see transformations or watch movies. Or read. Play some solitaire on. My my kindle fire. I don't usually realize i'm at until later it doesn't really come up. And i i just tend not to have the kind of life where. Those situations arise. Sometime soon of sometimes on the road. I get a little annoyed i don't get annoyed so much alike. When people cut me off or anything like that. But when people are deliberately rude and. And. In a honk for no reason or. You know it when they get angry because maybe i've done something inadvertent he'll cut them off by mistake and you know like. They get really angry then that makes me angry and return. Yeah like i said i didn't really get into arguments. I did have i was with a friend the other day and. She got annoyed with me because she felt like i was correcting her. So it wasn't really an argument but. She. I had said something that. She heard us a correction well it was a correction. And she got angry. Well then i felt criticized and i felt i felt vulnerable. I wasn't it was it was pretty uncomfortable. And that situation. I didn't i didn't have to correct her. So. I think. That's something i'm starting to look at in myself is my need to. Bi-rite. So in general. That's i'm trying to. To catch that and. Just let people. Make mistakes with without my telling them about it. I don't know. That's tuff. I can't. I don't know that i've had that much trouble making decisions. Well. Hard for me to decide. 2. Put my cat to sleep when he was sick. Oh it was and i had to give up a cat. And i was moving once and. And that was difficult to. Wellman case of the first cat the winner was sick. I decided when. The vet. Said that he thought it was the humane decision. And with the cat i had to give up i didn't. I. Didn't really decide i was moving to a place that. Where i couldn't take her. And so i. I found somebody who could take her. Try that stuff. I don't really. The erasing from the memory part. Or something i really wish i could erase from my memory. Trying to think of something that i've done that i. Wish i hadn't done. Oh okay i remember something there there was a time when i was. I was in a class at junior college. That was a film class. And. I was. I was the one who was. After we. We went out and did a little film project. And we're supposed to bring it back into class the next week. I was the one who had the film. And through different. Just things that were happening in my life right now and never went back to the school but i never. Brought them the film back so all the work they had done. I'm bad to do over again and i still feel bad about that. Sometimes i wake up. In the early morning hours and and have trouble going back to sleep but. That's not very often. I've been feeling tired and low-level depressed. Like not feeling a lot of options. No. Yes i have. How long ago were you. Oh there were two times there was once back in the like 1970. 90 about 1972 or 3 and then. Another time. Oh so the woman that have been in bed 16 years ago. Just feeling like. There wasn't. You know feeling the feeling that things weren't going to change. If i didn't get some help. And that. If i. I didn't have to let you know that maybe if i got some medication that would help me. And the short-term. I'm not going to therapy right now. Carondelet finances there wasn't really feeling the need starting to think it might be a. An option again. I feel like therapy can be useful. Or when i went to therapy. It was helpful to have somebody who listened and. Could also. Offer impartial suggestions for helping made it. Improve the way i was feeling. Tell me about the lab. I was on the beach last weekend. Beautiful day and i was. Sitting in the sun and. Just relaxing i had my notebook and i was doing some writing and. I felt very happy and content. I'm kind and compassionate and i'm a good listener. And i'm intelligent and i have five good ideas. What are some things you wish. Well i wish that. Sometimes i wish i was a harder worker i'm not really willing to take. Low-wage jobs even though. I need work so i just don't feel like i'm willing to do anything. And. I wish i could act said i had good ideas. I have good ideas and i'm good at the. The onset but i'm not really good on the follow-through so. A lot of those ideas get started but then. I don't take them the distance. That's probably the. The thing i'd like to change my myself the most. 10 or 20 years ago i can myself the advice to go back to school and get my degree. Finish my education. And be willing to. To work. A regular job and two. To start putting money. Away for my. That retirement. Proud of my children. And i am proud of the friendships i have. And. I'm proud that. That. People people do admire me. And value my opinion. Goodbye. Okay. Uk. Thank you honey. \n",

      "Thank you. Yes. I'm good thank you. I was born in mexico city. Yes. About 34 years ago. Yeah. I tried to go back once a year but i haven't been about three years. Haven't had. The time and i've traveled other places but i'm planning on going back probably next year. Well i can't ever see myself moving back to mexico city it's a huge huge city and. I like la more there's more opportunities and. I just feel at home here. My family moved here like i said i was very young and my parents moved to california to work and then we just ate here. I love traveling i have not traveled as much as i would like to but i do love to travel. Just seeing new things meeting people from other countries to stop. Feeling relaxed and having no worries because you're on vacation. I just love being. And other places. The last ship i took was a 7-day cruise. And it went to st thomas barbados st lucia. St-martin. And it was amazing i would love to do that trip again. I think going to mexico the last time i was there i went to the pyramids still be walked on and i have not been there in many years and it was amazing to see the pyramids and i can't even imagine how they were able to build such great structures. I consider myself more psy. In social situations i kind of feel uncomfortable. I'm not one to just go up to people and start conversations. If people come up to me of course i'll talk to them but i feel slightly awkward just kind of out of place at a party. I actually studied history. I've always been interested in history and i just wanted to learn about histories from other cultures and. Of course us history. So i'm very interested history. I'm actually working in the education field. My dream job would actually be traveling around the world and having a show on like the travel channel that would be my dream job because i would get paid to travel and it's something i enjoy to do. So i would love to do that as a job. I love reading. And i love taking baths so to relax i like to take a bath and i read while i'm in the bath. And i also like going to the gym that helps me. Deal with stress and. It actually relaxes me even though i'm exercising. I used to be not very good at controlling it when i was a kid i would get mad very easily and sometimes as an adult i still get angry easily but i've gotten a lot better. Trying to think about things first before saying them and. Not. Having outbursts. Things like that. The last time i argued with somebody was probably about a week ago it was my best friend. And she actually she has kids i don't. And for some reason she thought. Or thinks that i think i'm a better person than she is and because i went to school and she didn't and she's home with the kids and you know i'm able to do more things. I don't think i've ever made her feel that. I i've been i definitely know i don't feel like i'm better than her but for some reason she accused me of that and we had an argument about it. Well that's situation i wish i had handled differently because. When she was talking to me she was very upset and. I started off pretty calm just trying to reason with her and let her know that i certainly didn't feel like i was better than her. But towards the end of the conversation it just kind of turned into a yelling match between the two of us and i wish i had been able to just stay calm and. Maybe ask her to call me later once you come down instead of just. Continuing the argument. I was angry at first but once we hung up i felt really bad about the situation. I felt that. Maybe i could have just let her. Let out all her feelings and then try to speak to her calmly. Instead of yelling at her to. Oh wow. That's a tough one i think. Guys i think one of the hardest decisions i've had to make his breaking up with a boyfriend of 7 years. Although i knew but it was the right thing to do i was. Kind of hanging on to the fact that we have been together for so many years and. I kind of fell by ending the relationship. I would have wasted those last 7 years of my life so. Is a pretty tough decision to make but i realize that it was the best decision for me at the time and i'm actually glad i did. Because then i went on to me. My husband. Thank you. Well about. I would say. Maybe. 15 years ago i was. Hanging out with a couple of friends at a. Club. And they met some guys and they invited us back to their place. And i really didn't want to go because i didn't know these people and i mean i knew their names and that's about it. But my friends really wanted to go and i wasn't the one driving so i decided to just go along with them. Back at their house. One of the guys actually pulled me into a room and. Try. I got scared i yelled. He tried to choke me and i thought i was going to die right there right there and i was going to kill me. But luckily one of my friends knocked on the door because she heard me scream and we left so it could have been a worse situation but i still think about it and wish that i could erase it from my mind. I was. We have a pretty good relationship i am close to i have a sister and a brother. My sister is two years younger and my brother is two years older. And we get along pretty well. My sister and i used to be best friends but then we grew apart and then now we're actually closer i think than ever. And have a pretty good relationship with my parents. My dad still treats me like i'm a little kid sometimes which annoys me. But i think we have a pretty good solid relationship. I usually wake up. A few times throughout the night. So i think it's rare for me to sleep. The whole night through ever. And i do feel a little. Like tired in the morning when i wake up it's hard i'm not a morning person definitely. So yeah it's kind of hard to get a good night sleep. I don't know i have hard time falling asleep. And then sometimes i have bad dreams or. I need to get up to use the restroom. But yeah. I don't matter the last time i actually slept the whole night without waking up at least once. Emotionally good. I'm actually on vacation right now from work so that's really nice. Physically i feel good i haven't been to the gym in a while so that kind of. Makes me feel. Bad cuz i like working out. But health-wise i'm good. No. No. It was. Lot this past weekend i actually went out of town with my husband we didn't go very far we went to santa barbara but. We really enjoyed ourselves we've been wine tasting and. Went to the beach and just had a really good time. She would probably describe me as a good caring person. Paisans. Very shy. 2 paise to that i have a hard time saying no to people when they ask me for favors cuz i'm always doing things for other people. That's how i think she would describe me. I wish i was more outgoing. I wish. That. I. What else. Definitely more outgoing. So i could have more friends i don't have a large group of friends because i am very shy. I also wish that i could have more patience than i do sometimes i'm very sort of patients. And i wish i could. Find a better job so i could do more traveling. Yes i actually took a really long time after high school to go back to school and get my degree. And i really wish that i could have. You know taking care of it a lot sooner than i did. And i also regret spending seven years of my life with my ex-boyfriend. I would have told myself to stay focused on school that. Going out and hanging out and just. Going to parties was not as important as i thought it was and that my education should always come first. I'm proud but after so many years of not being in school i was able to. Go to ucla and get my degree. Yeah that would be my proudest. Achievement. Okay. Thank you. Bye. \n",
      "Okay. Thanks. Hello. Yes. Okay. Not. Too bad. I'm from chicago. Southside. Back in 1978. When i was 18. Lately not much maybe once every two or three years. It's totally different now. Horrible weather in the. It's just a whole different atmosphere. Let's see my mother had moved to africa. I graduated from high school. And i had a friend out here so i just thought well let me try la. Very easy actually yeah i loved it from the moment i got off the airplane. Yeah. Number one the weather. Son is very important to me. I love the weather. I don't know just kind of a more laid-back atmosphere. Variety. Of people. And now it's my. My homebase you know. My. Friends. That are family. That's how i like my family is here now. I guess small hug earthquakes. Traffic. Just basic things like that really. I don't currently but i did throughout my life i travel. Quite a lot. I just seen. Sing. Other cultures and. Thing i'm more history and. Meeting people and. Just fun at the fun of it as well. Let's see well one trip. I went to. England. Ireland and scotland and france. All in. You know. One-trip. So that was a nice variety. I guess you could say probably skiing. And valdis air france. That was fun. I'm glad i got to do that. I'm kind of shy by nature i've tried to grow out of being shy so. I'm not fully sure but i was always up and extremely shy. Child. But now here in culver city this is my environment and i i guess you could say i'm not really shy and in my hometown of culver city. To relax i like to just curl up in my bed and read my book take a nap. Watch tv. Sometimes on the couch in the living room. Just so you know stay at home and. Kind of vegetate. Pretty good my temper is pretty level. Probably with my. Husband. And. I can't remember the moment what it was about. Well when you say my family do you mean. My. Family from childhood or my current family. Okay well i guess my current family comes to mind i have two daughters. My relationships. Pretty good it's okay with them but they're teenagers which. You know. Going they're going through a lot of hormones and. They can be kind of preachy. And. And but i have hope that you know they'll grow out of bed and someday we'll have a really good relationship. And then there's the husband which. Hi. Guess i could face soon-to-be-ex-husband hopefully soon. We need to get. A divorce but we're still together. Due to financial reasons. And yet. Yeah so that that's not good. Relationship with the husband. But. But since we have determined that we need to divorce. We don't expect anything out of each other so we don't argue as much so that's good. Well. I guess. Our marriage. I wish i had noticed early on that. You know it was like way off from what i thought it was. What's a my god. Hardest decision. I guess leaving my first husband that was pretty hard. Well you know we were married and i wasn't. Content i guess you could say. And. I kind of just. Gave up on our relationship. Now that i look back i think it's because. Children and he would have been happy to never have any. And so since i didn't have a father. It was very important. That i. Create children with someone who really wanted to be a father. And so i was kind of. At an age where i needed to start thinking about. Having children. Yet i was with someone who really was not into it so that. I think that's one maybe the core reason why i was not the content and i just. Felt like. This marriage isn't going to work and. So you know we went to therapy and everything and he did not want to break up and. And i had to leave him. Because i just wasn't happy and that was i was very. Hard cuz. You know. Felt like i was hurting him which which i was bound he survived he got over now he's. Married with two kids. It was. Harned. To leave him. Something i wish i could erase from my memory. Have to think about that. I'm sure there's something. Well. Yeah there's some. I guess it'd be nice to erase. From my memory a recent i'm not resend but an event. In my. Recent adulthood here in culver city. We're one of my best friends. Betrayed me by. Back years ago when my husband first got into real estate. She and her family were growing and they really needed a larger home. And. We just assumed you know that they would use. My husband as their agent both to sell their current home current at the time and purchase a new home. And as it turned out. They surprised us and. Have been talking to this other local agent. And yeah. That was devastating. I don't think i've ever been betrayed. Like that. I wish i could erase that. Not cuz now you know this was back when the kids were really young. And. My daughter at the time i youngest daughter was let's say. 6 maybe. Maybe five. Anyway. Her and my best friends. Daughter are the same age they were born within days of each other. We were pregnant together. And dumb. They were really tight those two little girls and they ended up not going to the same elementary school so they didn't get to hang out during those years but every time we run into them in the neighborhood. Run into each other at a summer camp or something they were just so connected they were. Just you know like two peas in a pod even though it's her. Their moms weren't talking to each other anymore. So now they're 13 and 14 and they're in middle school together. And they're still very connected in fact. She she for the first time spent the night at our house last night with my daughter. And another girl. And it's just a little awkward you know cuz now these girls are. Becoming really good friends better friends. And yet. I still have this. Vivid. Bad memory. Of what her. Her mom did too. Tumi. That was about what. 10. About 8 years ago. Anywhere. I tried it i tried it. Ignored and put it out of my head which i've been able to. In recent years. But obviously it still comes up. Anyway that was that. Not that easy. I do sometimes get a decent night's sleep but. Sometimes it's. Hard to get to sleep and most of the time i wake up. And can't get back to sleep. Iri finally get back to sleep and then it's almost time to get up you know that. Circle thing. Well the waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the bathroom. And then. You know it's not always that easy to get back to sleep and then i wake up again to go the bathroom. So i guess that's the trigger. As far as getting to sleep hard time there. I don't know i think there's just too much on my mind. Running through my mind the day and i feel like i haven't accomplished enough during the day so. It's hard for me to just go to sleep when i'm supposed to. Borgess. Well i'm kind of used to it now. Should i just go on. Tuesday probably looking. Looking tired and. Like i'm kind of used to feeling tired i just do what i need to do. And sometimes if i'm able to if i'm at home and don't have. Huge commitments yeah i might just like i said earlier just take a nap or something. Read my book watch tv whatever. Lately i've been feeling. Kind of down. On myself down on life. Well i have this pending. Need for separation / divorce. I'm worried that i made a lot of mistakes with my girls now they're teenagers. You know on the verge of adulthood. And so i worried that. You know. I did all kinds of things wrong. But their guidance in their early childhood and now it's too late. Like i missed out on a lot of things. And yeah i need a job i'm unemployed i don't know what i want to do with my life. I know i want to do something on. I just wish. You know i never did finish college unfortunately because i was traveling and stuff. So i regret that extremely. And i need to get a job and be able to take care of myself cuz i need to. Divorce and move on with my life. So. Now i forget what the original question was but. That's the state. Part of the state of my life. No. Yes. Well. The first time or or. Her recently. The first time i guess was. I know when i was in my early twenties i was just a little. Upset about constantly that was another breakup i had to make back then. Havasu. In my early twenties and i needed to break up with my boyfriend but again it was very upsetting cuz i. You know it's hard because he didn't want to break up and i felt like i was hurting him and i didn't understand this feeling. I was really upset. How did that was my first time having depression so i didn't really. Recognize it as depression. But i went somehow. Have the. Knowledge or the. I was able to. Take myself to a psychiatrist remember i paid for her by the hour. And she prescribed xanax. Chet just help relax me. And so i guess that helped me get through that. And then i've had depression throughout the years just seeing a little bits here and there for various reasons such as. I guess it's usually a relationship you know. Yeah so the most recent time i was diagnosed. And put on meds. That was probably about. 2 years ago. No. Money and i don't have insurance. Otherwise yeah i'd be happy to. Go to therapy. Anything that might help. Last time i felt really happy. I don't know i guess maybe. When my children were born. I guess happy i just you know. I always wanted children so it's nice. To have them. That's. I don't know that's all i can remember of that. How do i guess i do remember the good times too well. Remember the bad times. Something i did that i really enjoyed. Well. That's the way i am. Friday night i went to a friend's house. And met up with. Five other girlfriends and we. We created vision boards. And talked and. Had dinner. At one of their house that was that was fun. We get to. Stay in college get my degree. Get therapy trying to become happy. Yeah try to figure out things earlier in life. Like. Yeah. Stay in college and and mainly i think the mean you know what it all boils down to no matter what your depressed about it seems like. As the saying goes in the. Songs go you know. It's all about money the world revolves around money in. Having none. That in itself is for depressing. So besides relationships and different things that have happened in your life. Having no money. As. You know it's like you can't even try to fix anything because you don't have the money to fix it. So. With that in mind i would definitely advise myself to get my college degree. And to get a job and stick with it. Don't quit. To go traveling in o. Just stick with a job stick with a company build up your. Seniority keep your benefits. And build up some knowledge or some expertise in some sort of field. Yeah that would have been. My biggest piece of advice to myself. Not much. I guess. Just my daughter's you know.. Beautiful daughters. I'm proud and glad that i was able to have children some people. Aren't even able to do that you know and they. Try so hard or they look back on their life and they wish they had done it so. That's the one thing i mean i wanted. Five children and i always wanted a boy which i never had but. I guess that's the. Biggest thing i can. Think of to be proud of. Having my two daughters. I'm a very loyal. Friend and person. That's why. When that friend betrayed me i was so devastating. Yeah very loyal very. Happy mother's day going to say i was going to say happy go lucky i don't know where that came from. I'm very immense a friendly. And. Caring and. Yeah i care about people. And i'm interested in people. And. I care about. Animals as well actually that's another thing i'm proud of proud of being a vegetarian. Yeah so my daughters and being vegetarian. And i'm a vegetarian because i. Really care about. Feelings of other beings not only humans but animals too and. You know i don't think that animals should be. Tortured. And liver. Torturous life. Just so we can eat them. So. What was the question. Remember the question. Okay. You're welcome. Spy. I did need the tissue one time so that's good. \n",
      "When it's always female. Yes. I'm okay thank you. I was born in east los angeles. Yes. The freedom to explore outdoors with different weather temp with weather. Temperature. Requirements to go skiing or. The beach maybe in the same day. I think probably be overcrowding. And the smog. Not not frequently but i have. Meeting other people and learning about their environment and their cultures. Sure i'm the last trip i've taken outside of. Here was to italy. And. That was my second time being there. And i enjoyed it more this time. Because. I knew what i wanted to say when i came back and. That was better prepared. 4. Italians and their culture rei felt i wasn't as you know i was just better prepared i thought. For that trip. That would be. Being in the countryside and staying a very tiny house. In the mist of. Acres and acres and acres of grapes with just make nificent. Human development. I actually didn't decide it first to do that i. Started school with the intent of being a lactation consultant. And i went to program and which you could get a degree as well as get your license to become a lactation consultant. And through the process i learned that i had to do a long internship without pay and at the time and i miss i had a family so i had to make a career choice quickly. And i'm so the college offered. Human development major and i. Just went right in and used my use my units that i had already acquired towards that particular major in. And i'm happy with it. I'm currently no i stayed home i have a little one. Ollie's not-so-little i'm preparing to go back to work. Meantime i design jewelry. Well i have three. Children i have almost four-year-old and then i have two older children. 17 + 23. No. That your children that the love from them and for them is unconditional. All the stages that they go through their stages all the time for every age. Didn't everybody in my household this all different because they're different ages. I think i'm probably more in tune with those different stages. That's why it makes me crazy. And i think that my parents the time that my parents were parents. He was just kind of like. You know that she fed is she dressed. She's a house i mean a roof over her head. And we're doing greatest parents and we love her and so. It wasn't there wasn't too much i felt that that parents thought about in terms of. And terms of parenting in that way and like today you know there's books for every age every year month you know and. So i think it difference differs in that way. Tremendously. Very close. Outgoing. I don't i don't feel uninhibited. I feel. Confident to talk to people. I probably talk. More than i need to. What are you doing. Abid. I do i design jewelry that's what i do to relax. I'm pretty good ii. Well i think i. Try not to. Not to feel or let others know what my emotions are. When i'm upset. Which is not good. Because if i don't do anything with them then i know that some point it's going to come out. And. Yeah that. That sucks something after work on. Like exercising or something. It was my husband and it was about. He asked me whether i thought about cheating. Ever in our marriage. I am. Really tired of talking about that same topic. Well it came it spawned from. I'll clean up my husband's who's a female and she shared with him that she'd been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for many things. And so he took that information and came home and decided to ask me if i ever thought about it and what made me. Think about cheating in. He knows that i've been resentful of him and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did i think about cheating. And. I we've had this conversation a lot of times. And i mean not just that but. I don't know just about cheating general and so i just said what i normally said normally is that i haven't. Cheated and that i. Did think about that when we were first together. And i thought it was just a thought. And. And then his response was i know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another. And that just came out. I guess irritated me i was really bothered by that. And i just started liking you know we're having this conversation yet again and why are we having this conversation are you the one that's cheating and so that's how that that went into. That argument i mean he wasn't yelling at me and was part conversation and part texting. Not talking. At all. Pretty much any situation that involves my children and if i've yelled. Because i really don't like. If i came to the point where i've had more of yelled it bothers me because. I was yelled at. A lot. And i just. Feel bad about that and i. Try really hard to not. Handle any kind of situation that involves my children no matter how upset i might get. And resultant and yelling. That would probably be whether to keep. A pregnancy or not. Yeah. Yeah i am. I was just talking about it yesterday actually. And. I'll always pregnant and. I had wanted i wasn't married yet and i had wanted to be married and but i just. Didn't think that it was the right time for me. And i. I had. Pretty much made up my mind that i was not going to keep that pregnancy. But i made the decision by myself. And when my partner. Found discovered that i was pregnant. She said that he very much wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me. And so that decision was quite hard. Because i felt obligated to do so. And felt super guilty tonight and. That was probably the hardest decision actually not know i wouldn't say that's the hardest decision i've ever had to make i'm sorry the hardest decision that i had to make. In my life was whether or not. The hospital should. Unplug the life. Life support machine for my father or not. That was our decision. Because i knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself with more than that. Antepian. But to resort to the situation that he was in. Not capable of doing anything at all either speaking. From self. Was beyond. Fuki wise and i just couldn't see him. Like that anymore and he would be a vegetable i was told. So i agreed. To amritsar.. Not. Hardly ever. Too many things running on my mind. Pretty much. Mostly on the weekends because my older kids are out and about with their friends. Even though i. Know that they're going to i mean i'm constantly worried about. How they are when they come home and so you really can't fall asleep on the weekends most time. But. Sometimes it's just been so many days of not getting good night sleep i'm just exhausted i pass out. But it's hard. Very stressed. My son is is. Has been. Yeah in. Dealing with some legal issues and. Currently is incarcerated. And. It's been really hard. Yes i've been probably very short. Moody irritable. Well i often think about a lot of things that aren't even happy. My mind just goes from when. Point a to point b and i don't even know how i got there. You know. It's interesting. Yeah. Yes. About 3 years ago. My. Obg. Suggested i. I. She a psychiatrist. Yes. Well. I've. In the process of changing therapists so it's been about. Because the program that i was in. Lost funding and i lost my therapist. Dar the therapist that i was working with and so it's been. About. 2 months. Maybe three now. And but i did notice when i was in therapy. Did it was just an intricate part of my. My life my week 2. See my therapist. It really helped me. Cope. When i picked up my son from. When he was released. From. Gel. I go gather probably you know. She is a term hustler but meaning. That aisle. I'm not afraid to. Do a lot of different kinds of jobs to. Do what i need to do to support my family i mean you know legally of course. Outgoing. Maybe sometimes a little 242 outgoing for her. And. Compassionate. Sensitive. Loyal. All the things that remind me of my mother. Well yelling the yelling part was when. Just the little things that. Used to drive me so crazy i can see myself. Doing them and it bothers me a lot. Regarding what. Not too much really i don't know. To go to college right after high school. Not right. And. That i didn't really need to be in a relationship to be happy. And our that you don't have to be in a relationship to be happy that you can certainly be successful and. Not in a relationship and still be happy and. Live life. I do. I visit my son yesterday and that was really good. I was happy that he was safe. My children. And. My accomplishments. And now. School and work. Bye. Propane is tilted back and i came off okay and it did not get got everything you needed. \n",
      "Okay. Yes. Okay. Fine. San fernando valley. I'll i really like the cultural of going to museums and being able to go at night and having lots of people around. It's spread out a lot and it's a pain in the ass have to drive everywhere and that have a good public transportation system. I'm sure you can tell them. I'm not really like to go camping but i don't really travel. I think. I might have been around six months ago i went on a trip with a geology class. Yeah it was fun. I think it's tough to say. Well i think the first time i went camping was probably really memorable island to death valley and i got to see a lot of really cool things and hang out with my friends at night. Philosophy. Yes. I don't know i think it just sort of happened i wanted to be a journalist for a really long time and then i kind of grew disillusioned with that and i liked. All the different. Ways are all different things i could do with philosophy. What's your. I don't know but i really like children and i really like. Cutting their behavior so i think something along those lines might be at. I think i'm generally pretty outgoing i can't be sure on my family but when i'm around friends and stuff i i think i'm pretty friendly. What are you doing. Watch tv or read. I think i'm pretty good i don't really get mad i try to think about other things if i start getting or. I just started trying to focus on my breathing. The last time i argue with someone else probably with my boyfriend. I'm having trouble remembering the last thing we argued about was. I think it what i wasn't feeling very well and i was having trouble deciding whether i wanted to go to his department's end-of-year party and he was getting frustrated. Which i thought was very inconsiderate cuz i wasn't feeling well to begin with. Well i felt like he wasn't really taking my feelings into consideration and. Really hate when he got stressed out i gets angry easily because i just see that as a necessary and it stresses me out. Eating a lot of times when my. Oldest youngest brother when my oldest little brother does something wrong i tend to be harsh with him we're not as close. As my sister and i or my youngest brother and i. I'm so he tends to be hostile back and i think that if i were little bit more gentle maybe easier to communicate with him. When i was 19. I came home. Travel party i think around 4 a.m. on a sunday morning and my dad got really mad at me and yelled at me and said a lot of that very nice things and then he didn't speak to me for about a year. I want my relationship with my mom is a lot better now that i don't live at home i used to be really frustrated with her all the time cuz she has a really quick temper but i think now that i've got a little bit more just since i can see that she does the best that she could. And i love my siblings. Again my little sister and i get along really well she's. 4 years younger than me. When. When she was around 12 and i was around sixteen was really difficult cuz she really harsh templar and she was always moody and i wasn't. In a place to be patient with that sort of stuff so we fought all the time but we don't anymore and that's really great. And. We get along okay with my. My older little brother who's 15 and i think i got on pretty well with my youngest brother who's 12. One of the first not the first but one of my first philosophy professors and i really loved her classes me was really good. I'll being in class with a professor who really cared and. Who really engaged people that was. Really motivating since not all my classes were like that. How is your day. I think it's pretty easy sometimes i have trouble going to sleep but. Jelly found the bandits i think it's usually harder for me to wake up in the morning. I'm really tired i can get grumpy. Groggy. I'm a little anxious about. About getting a job and i'm going to be taking for my school but it's only one class so a lot of free time. Well. I mean it's not the end of the world if i don't get a job and i know that i will eventually so we'll swing i just try not to think about it too much and i tried not to be pessimistic. Have you ever been. No. No. I think last time i felt really happy i. Went to a party with my boyfriend matt and does apartment party and. I wasn't you know i knew a couple people there so i felt comfortable but i was also able to meet new people and there are a couple of kids there especially on the pool and a couple of drinks and ate some food and it was fun. She'll probably say that. Smart. Pretty intellectual i love to read and to watch. Really like series films and tv. And you probably don't say them fun cuz we like to go out and have fun a lot. Well i can be really disorganized and i gets me in trouble sometimes it will so that's a major length on and procrastinating. I got into a little bit of trouble few months back and have to go to court and was. Given. 50 some hours of community service and of course i procrastinated on doing that so i have to show up to court against an extension and the judge was very mean and he didn't seem as he yelled at me but it's in the same. Like he gave it much thought it seemed like it was just sort of us stock. Bt gave everyone that he thought needed some yelling at so i understand cuz that's his job but it was. Great for me cuz i wasn't i was really anxious in that situation. Oh i would have been 12 and 2. I think. I think i would have told myself at 12 not to be so hard on myself and not to be so hard on my parents. Cuz i think. I was a little selfish and self-involved. I can't really think i regret how i treated my mother when i was a kid but everyone does that and. I do regret. A couple of. Semesters ago i didn't do so well in school and i got a. A few w's which i now have to work to get off on my transcripts. You done anything to. I think so i am. I think. I wasn't focusing in school at that time. And i didn't see any counselors at school or anything so i definitely couldn't find that. Probably spend my ideal weekend sleeping in saturday and then going to the duck pond by my house and feed my dachshund some oranges and then maybe.

Within that lies to get them to give them the confidence in the motivation they need a life. Cuz a lot of don't get it. When i see people do really really. Stuff that they really shouldn't be doing. It really eats me i mean really bothers me. And when people. Talk to you they give you the run-around it's like won't you just be straight with me instead of just give me the the run-around was just be straight up with me. That can be very frustrating.

Yeah. Very good. This morning. Yeah wake up pretty you know out at first thing i do when i wake up in the morning i pray so. When is verason connection. With the. The universe in the world i feel pretty good. Yes. Up and down. Uno. Because i'm motivated to get out and start doing other things in life and just not doing anything at all. And then other times where you want to get something accomplished and you can't really get it done because there's roblox in the y but. I'm learning how to overcome those roblox's. Well for instance looking to go to school and i was having problems. Getting enrolled in school. I will talk to one of my social workers and she was willing to help me get online and to do it so i'm like okay it was going to get done. Yeah. Can you repeat that one more time. Yes i have. Dad-to-be. I say the last couple of weeks. I noticed that. I go to certain situations like you was talking about the anger situation it's like i don't get angry all the time that's not me. Tell sometimes when i get angry i have to find out what's causing all this what's what's causing me to get angry. And i have to take. Excuse me ma'am. It's not hard at all i've got to do is just take your time in the reflect about everything that you have gone through and. Take a good look at the situation and. And then go from there and find out what's really bothering you. It's very seldom. I suffer from ptsd. And getting that type of sleep. Would be would be great. Because i have recurring nightmare so. The incident so. I. I think it is and i don't know what is triggered by. But i think it is and that's why i'm talking to someone or seeing someone cuz i'm a veteran. At the va about the situation now. About to pgsd basically right now. Change mail. A lot of nightmares lot of problems lie by anger issues. Depression. I noticed all this in me and. I started. just started. Just tell myself i needed help. And as that's basically i just you know i just. You know i did something wrong with something one right with me. And when something's not right with me i have to take time out to do. You know take a good look at myself and ask myself if something's right then you did something right then that's fine if something not right then you need to take care of it. And i just start shaking out down there yeah. Someone yes it is someone. Because i'm able to sit down and talk to the therapist. You want me to sit down and talk to the therapist and tell him i situation and we usually will go over the problem. And. I went to classes i've been to. Talking one-on-one with my own doctor. Show us helping a little bit. Yeah. That's good thing. Excuse me. No not really. My best friend. They he will describe me as. Fun-loving good person. Always there. try to help others. Thank more bothers really than more myself but when i know i needed things need to be done for me. I take care of it. So you know they really. Actually they really look up to me they have a lot more respect for me. Yeah they see something in me they wish that bad. Schedule now. Can you be a little bit more specific. Okay. Book. Crossword puzzles. Walking. That's about it. I thought i did but i don't think i do i don't think i regret anything because. This is this is how it is. This is the way it is for me so i accept it and i keep moving on. Because if i regret anything in the past. Then i'm wasting my time on that because it's gone that's the past i need to move on i need to live in the present so i can be prepared for the future. Like move on to the future. Yeah. More education. Being more direct and more confidence in what i'm doing. Like i am today so. Yeah that's what i was lacking maybe 20 years ago. Yes i have had a lot of positive people been been in my life. Yes i'm people with consistently motivate me. To continuing to pursue a certain goal. And. Thought that was pretty good because. I really don't see that a lot. And. They gave me a lot of motivation to try to go up and try to do something cuz anything that you do is a choice. It's up to you. Whether or not if you do it or not that choice is still up to you for it to be done. Disneyland. That i'm able to. Really. Be able to be self-motivated. And really be able to put my best foot forward. And be able to get a lot of things accomplished. thought i couldn't. But it can be accomplished. If i'm willing enough to put the will to it. Paul while huh. Oh really and you know what i really enjoy. Was sitting down with my social worker and we're talkin about. Getting things done within my life. A school was one of them. And just being just go was one on that kind of liked it that because i was the first time someone was willing to really sit down with me and work with me. Yeah and i thought that was a great dane so as long as you're willing to do that and i'm willing to go even the extra mile. And even be motivated to do other things besides school. And yeah then then that's what gets me going. Holiday is and i love it and this is going to be accomplished. Thank you. Goodbye. Yeah i think she's through. Jack. she was really human. Wow.

I would say 10 my told my dad that he should act like a father. Maybe i should. Yeah there was a. That was actually one of the times i. Another time i went off usually with him mom. Basically i had decided not to go to a private. Not to go away for college. I want i decided to stay local so i can look after my little brother. And. My senior year i was overloading with everything i had maybe like. For ap classes. I was working if i was working three jobs at the time and i lost one track and field. So. Mimi's cafe hours. I'll come like bring myself out. And i. I wasn't doing 180 calculus. If i decide to go to a jc first and transfer also the save money for college to. And when i told him you know the teacher called saying of falling asleep in class just because mine's you after school like working 8 hour shifts el cerrito manager at the time. So i'm. I come home after that shift to do homework calculus let alone so. She would get upset and i told him i spoke my accounts already told him that i don't need that class to go to the jc that's something that a continuous i'm just going to i can't drop out. At that point in time so i'm just going to let you know. Discuss. Take the. Deer fail whatever. And. He didn't he didn't like that cuz he is a teacher. And so. He started blaming like my dogs wanted to call my boss and it was it was just too much and i told him. Yeah. Since you're my father should act like it. What else has a more aggressive. That was. One thing i do remember i do regret one thing. And that is i wish i continued. With college throughout. Like i i i burnt myself out.

I wish. Maybe. I don't know if it's a. Bmore. I want to say be more in touch with my emotions i think. I would say. Understanding people's how people feel about me in their shoes. I think that would be one thing because i'm the type of person. Where. People say that they love me or care about me and i'm like okay great thank you i appreciate that bottom realize how much. They do i think that's not realizing how much they care and love me. That's one thing i like to. Get more. Popeye. Grasp on. My best friend she described me as someone who's funny. Crazy. Objective.

I don't judge i can i'm a computer. I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get it started. And please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential. Where are you from originally. Asco. Measurements. My family moved to the us and then i moved down here eventually for college. How easy was it for you to get used to living in la. I took a long time to i've been living here for about a year since i graduated for those with a lot of ups and downs but. Finally got into dustin to it so it took a while though. That's good. Are you like your living situation. I doze off and on i have two roommates in the zoe laverne drama here and there between the girls but for the most part after a year couple months i think we finally learned how to live together but it was. Pretty much like a reality tv show for awhile. Yes. How do you know then. When's from college and the other one found on craigslist. How close are you to them. A varies depending on whether or not we're mad at each other so i just pretty cuz. Right now i'm kind of distant. Tell me more about that. Eva the distance. Okay well we haven't seen each other around hung out in like 2 weeks. Cuz one of them got into a car accident and so she's been distant since then and kind of locks herself up in her room. And the other one is always working late so we are scheduling has been off. And nones we made an attempt to hang out with anyone so it's kind of. We're just waiting for someone i guess to make the first move. Yeah. That sucks. Okay i'll hear better. How are you at controlling your temper. It depends with whom. Dealing with i guess i would say was them people i guess is my family's not very good my boyfriend is not very good. Bad with other people that i might not smell so well then i'm able to control little bit more but a little more passive aggressive rather than like full-on anger. Why. I don't want them to see me as a ditch. Farmington. Houston has been a positive influence in your life. Probably my best friend nicole. She's probably been she's been we've been best friends forever. High school freshman year of high school when we first mall along time. Give me an example that. Of what. How do you know them. My friend to call. We met in french class freshman year of high school. We're in the same class and then we kind of surgeon homework together and we had a lot of clouds and same classes together and so you can start hanging out and then we became closer and stay really close since then. Nice. What are some things you like to do for fun. I going out with friends and the bar is going dancing biking hiking. Staying active when the movies going to see the restaurants that tography. Miss hanging out with friends i guess. Whatever. How close are you to your family. It's very it's like i'm really close to them when it comes to things about like school work. Does condom. Things but when it comes to relationships and friendships and more personal personal things. I don't really discuss that with them. Vegas superficially club. But i rely on them a lot. What are some things that make you really mad. I guess it depends who it is again. As people who are inconsiderate. Unthoughtful flaky. Ignorance. And. Yeah. Those kinds of people people just stand. Who is stenographer. It's a lot of things things. People react to. Different situations can make me angry i guess. When was the last time you arguing with someone and what was it about. Oh yesterday. And my boyfriend. And they argued because he's trying to be healthy and workout and save money. And though so biting that when he doesn't see orders pizza in so he's not saving money and he's not very healthy and so i got frustrated with him cuz i'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and that each time. Do you feel that way often. About other people about myself or angry. Whatever comes to your mind. Angry. Okay. What's your dream job. That is a tough one how about getting paid to be me. I don't know that's kind of what i'm going to figure out right now cuz i quit my full-time job because i hated it and it's mostly sitting in an office all day which i thought was extremely boring. So now i work in a restaurant job and i'm coming for a second job to support myself. My dream job. I don't know it would be but i know it involves people and i'd love to have some kind of like finished product or some kind of accomplishments wristband and yes i something i realized. I like to see. The result from all my hardware cuz i majored in sociology and as much as i love that major it's you realize it's a whole lot of theorizing and arguing but with no real solution so it was like at the end that's all you have is. Just be. Theoretical elements you can't do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for. Piece of paper with your amazingness. Something to do with people amazing artistic i love photography. I love cooking baking and particularly so i know something. And that. Mom i guess. Okay. You travel a lot. I used to travel a lot my family is known for traveling we've gone to. Star 78 different countries i've lived in the rear for different countries. I haven't traveled a lot lately just because i have no money. And jobs kind of tie you down but i would love to have that is my dream job would be a photographer for national geographic. That would be awesome. Or a food photographer that traveled. But anyways yeah i do travel a lot. What do you enjoy about traveling. In the new places new faces and experiences i get restless very easily it's it's nice to constantly on the move and. See different things and see different cultures and types of people. And not get stuck in the same routine i hate the routine and monday months of everyday life that's nice too. Does things.. I'd love to hear about on your trips. Okay. Nothing. I have even talked about i don't know it's funny even though i've been to lots of different country is one of my most memorable memorable trips at. One of the trips i took with my family's a three-week road trip with my family that's five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon. You start getting on each other's nerves but it was really fun and like even though i've traveled so many places. I realize that there's like such a beauty and the american landscape and summer all around the southwest and the grand canyon to zion to the grand tetons to yellowstone and it's absolutely amazing this thing of that natural beauty so. Grizzly bear black bear the bison wolf it's really cool. Zion's after while you're kind of gets old but it's like it already got the same idea. White old white man building great buildings in artwork. I'm beautiful or something that's different too. How easy is it for you to get a good night sleep. Pretty easy as long as i. Get supplies sleep so easy. What are you like when you don't sleep well. Grumpy and just very lethargic and just low energy. Don't say much i just kind of off in my own world. Do you feel that way often. I'm not not anymore i usually get enough sleep. And i've been working out more instead of kind of. Energizing me finesse not too bad. That's good. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately. Even just been more negative but i have to do it by circumstances kind of like. Been about almost 5 months since i quit my full-time job haven't found anything else until i found everything else i'm interested in. So. Eduardo's like what am i doing that kind of thing. Yeah. It can be tough to find a good job these days. Yeah it is. It is high at the market and was like i'm very picky cuz i don't want to just sit in a little my own cubicle to buy quit my job exactly for that reason so. Why do backs another job just do the same exact thing that i quit my other job. Does like i have to make it worthwhile that i quit my last job to get a better job so this is kind of like. Second section of like living paycheck-to-paycheck. Barely making it just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but it's like. When did i give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world has been cold. That sounds really hard. Yeah it's hard but i mean i guess everyone does that same situation after college so but. I guess it's half good lot of my friends and they went to a pretty good school. And you don't have a friend is teaching this niskanen stand another one has met the president you know the one that's doing teach for america and their friends in hartford schools like harvard mass. Do that comparison and then here i am working in a little restaurant job so. Do you feel down. I do sometimes yes but i'm going to hawaii next week's right now i'm fine. Yes. But yeah usually it's been kind of like down because i'm just trying to find like what i'm supposed to do you not like what do i want to do next. Money situations are just very stressful especially. School loans to pay off insurance rent car loans like answer. Grocery but i can't even afford groceries so it's just hard to like live this way especially after you paid so much money for like amazing college education so frustrating. Yeah. I'm sorry. Have you been diagnosed with depression. I don't think so but i mean. I think everyone goes to depression hand that is i don't know if you can. But not like medical diagnosis i'm not on meds. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd. New. Have you ever served in the military. Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago. Oh and things and not be afraid to. The number of those people from not going to be the best at something and i'm not snot going to try i accept the best or nothing at all go big or go home. So but i didn't get up till my high school south that don't try lots of things even if it means i'm not going to be the best at it. 10 years ago. Well. it made me like 12 so. I used to do a lot of thing but i used to act. And it got to continue doing that i used to write a lot when i was younger i used to write. Miniature like little story starts sorry it's from my parents all the time. Anaconda stop doing those things cuz it's like i'm not good at it so i'm not going to do it. Nothing going to just continue doing those things and tried see no difference. Classes. Dino defense for that kind of stuck with soccer going up button. Expand myself more rather than like 5 something i'm good at and just stay with it but never really try harder. Has like a bit i was going to say that one that was like once i'm good i just stay for good. Anthony said. What do you do to relax. All right now it's super lame but i watch tv. But i used to read a base to read on my off-time or just listen to music or just take a nap. Ebay. Bananas by since i'm on my feet all day and like constantly interacting with people i just kind of want to unwind by like sitting and lying on the couch and be like i'm done. Which one of your most memorable experience. The top question. I'm probably the day i got accepted into pomona college. I was a freshman at wellesley college courses that woman's college back east. And i hated it from mike the second from like the first week i just knew that i chose the wrong college not like miserable for the entire year. And i only apply to one school to transfer pomona college like that satin claremont. And. Animals going to get in and i also because like a 4% acceptance rate and if i go to the chances like this is ridiculous i don't think we can get in. And i was like another saddle going back to multiple super depressing. But then i got an email from one of the admissions counselors that i had met when i was visiting pomona and he's like hi tatiana like. Dependency theory last-minute questions about pomona hope all is well. And i was like why are you emailing me the day we find out if we got enochs that's it or not. Unless i got the acceptance. And so sure enough a couple hours later i got the email that i was accepted into pomona and i was like the best day of my life i was so. Happy. Yeah. Austin's going to take my mom and my little brother accident dinner and i went bought myself some new dresses just like one crazy dyed my hair.. Yeah. How do your best friend describe you. Beverly. Fine. Maybe moody you never know what you're going to get sometimes. Probably. Definitely friendly. Positive person. But sometimes maybe a little bit. Aggressive. The most rising positive things when she's my best friend so. Okay. When is the last time you felt really happy. Really happy. Oh and i was in mexico. Overwinter. No i don't know. My boyfriend took me on the sailing trip down and. San clemente and that was really fun and i just like when sailing and watch and admissions hung on the beach that was really fun. Don't forget time to greet situation school. Okay i think i've asked everything i need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. I didn't know you were super good thing. Recording town and we just have a quick food survey and then i can tell you a little bit more about what you can participate. \n",
      "Okay. Yes. Pretty good. Alexandria virginia. I'm to la. End of 2001. Yeah it's crazy. Couple times a year usually like for holidays. It is it's very different. I think it's a lot more mellow. It's way more like suburbia it's nice. If there's something comforting about it but it's always like i got a little restless when i'm there and look forward to coming back here where there's a little more action. I went to grad school at usc. It was it wasn't bad i mean my my program that i was in. Was so intense that. Lake for the first year. It was so all-consuming that i really didn't have much spare time to think about the adjustment it was just like my life is not my own so that made it kind of. Easier i guess and also i was like in a community of people that i went to school with so automatically i knew people and you know made friends and stuff so. It wasn't bad. Sound. I had an epiphany i was out of undergrad. I was kind of floundering a little bit i didn't really know what i wanted to do. And. Just one day i kind of was like you know what am i really excited about what am i really passionate about. And. I realize that movies are the thing that i love the most and most passionate about so that is how i decided to go to film school. A little bit yes and no it's sound like in a little bit of a transitional period right now but yeah like for the last several years i've been producing like freelance producer. That is so the question of the moment. I think that. I don't necessarily have like a job title that's my dream job but i know it sort of. What. I want it cuz basically like i've been living a freelance lifestyle for a while and i know that that is like exhausting and i don't want to do that anymore so i'm looking for something that's stable. You know full-time. Nice benefits and want to stay in the entertainment industry. And i like you know what i love about pretty thing is that it's just like there's constant challenges and assertive never know. What is going to get thrown at you that that's you know it's always interesting and exciting so i'm sort of trying to figure out right now what would be a good. Place for me to be where i can be reasonably challenged and you know have sort of a. Bike rim tube to grow and advance and all that. Yeah. I can't see your shoes i. I like to travel. I don't know that i haven't really been doing it a lot lately but i have you know in the past. Donna fairmount. I want the adventure of it just you know new sirius's new places new people. I think it's just good to sort of. Get out of your little insular world and see what's out there and just you know. Beautiful remarkable. Play said and things and just experienced different ways of living in different languages in different cultures. But see i went to costa rica a couple years ago. My black best friend from growing up she and i went for like 10 days. And it was that's probably. That might be like my. Favorite trip of all time. And we just spent like. We went to three different places and just did a lot of exploring and like sightseeing we did a ton of hiking which was amazing. And then with the last paper we ended up with this little beach town so by that point it was like we felt like you know we had done all this. Like amazing physical exertion like doing ziplines and all these hikes to the by the time i got to the beach it was like we've earned the right to just like kick back and relax and. You know so it was just it kind of. It hit all of the. You know it like said that sort of desire for adventure and activity but also. I'm also big fan of vacations or you just like veg out and relax and like my on a beach with a book so it's sort of. Did everything. What should i do to relax. I mean depending where i am like if it's you know something at work or something and i'm stressed out i just will. You know. Can i take a minute and just like breathing really deeply and try to just calm myself down that way. If i'm home i might just like. You know. Throwing a movie or like a tv show that i really like and just that gives a sense of like. Escape release. Pretty good i don't i mean. It took a lot to get me very angry it doesn't happen very often. The last time i argue with someone with my mom and it was about money. I felt really frustrated because i felt like she was. Like judging the unfairly. Another setting. It's good you know they live across country for me so i don't get to see them that often but. Like i usually talk to you. My mom on the phone probably like once a week and. My parents are really supportive. They are. Like when i go back home to visit like i didn't i enjoy hanging out with them we have a good time. Cytherea pretty. Pick a relationship. May i feel guilty about. I guess because i'm like in this. Turn job-hunting. Phase i feel guilty sometimes that i'm not like doing enough. You know like there are times where it like their days were maybe like i should have. I got a few more resume they're done more stuff like i i feel guilty sometimes for not being like productive enough. Usually it's pretty easy that lasts the last couple weeks like has been. Uncharacteristically like not as good. I'm not really sure i haven't figured it out. But i just had more. Like knights were. It either takes me a really long time to go to sleep or i wake up in the middle of the night for no reason. I've also been having a lot of like really. Weird intense dreams that like i wake up sometimes i wake myself because i'm talking this is weird so yeah it's just i don't know. Not that i have been able to identify i mean i guess maybe i'm like more stressed than usual just cuz like my job situation is like. Influx. I don't know if there's no like event. Cranky. I value good sleep and i'm so used to it so it's just that it's not a good. Getting. Not really no. Yes. Like. I think i'm like. October or november. Although this is the second time it's happened in my life but the first time was like. Many many years ago. I felt like i was. I really low and like too low for me to get myself out of it. Just having a hard time. Functioning and the most basic. Level like just. Getting up and. Taking a shower. And like going to the grocery store. And you know. Answering emails was just like. It took so much. Energy. See i just said i wasn't really. Functioning normally. Yes. Yes. Sometimes more than others but yeah overall i would say so. I think that's sarah p. Is good for me because it. Helps me focus on. My sort of patterns. And also like. Just like i'm deserving how i am like responding to certain situations and just i guess it's. Because we have more heightens like kind of self-awareness so that as opposed to just like. Reacting to situations i'm like. Just like noticing more what is going on. And it just helps to. I don't know it was helpful. I don't know. Play not good that can think of i can't think of anything. At maybe over. Over christmas being at home with my family. Yes. Well it just was. That was like. I was kind of. Like just starting to come out of my depression then. And. Like yeah i live alone here i have a dog but so i just had a long. of. Feeling. Not. Great and just. Doing it all on my own and kind of wishing that my family was around me. So when i was there with them it just. It just felt very like. Safe and comfortable and not just sort of like you know. Warm familial and brace. I think. She would describe me as. Funny. And smart. A good listener. Non-judgemental. I've got enough. Okay. So. This happens. The last like. Job that i had i mean i was it wasn't technically i was a freelancer but i was working for this company for like. A year-and-a-half closer to yours and. Had a very small company had a really good relationship with my boss and he's. Deserve out-of-nowhere. Told me that he was like downsizing basically and. Essentially like. The arrangement that we had is that he paid me like a monthly retainer for my services and then on top of that i would get paid fees per project. So he looks at me down in the conversation was like you know our major client that is like you know the bread-and-butter of the company they're like they're really coming back like you probably noticed things are getting really slow and i was like yeah so i'm going to have to stop paying you your retainer. And this is a total surprise i was like okay and he went on to talk about how. He. I would still have the right of first refusal of all the projects that came to the door and you know because of that he made it seem like you know even though i wouldn't be getting the retainer anymore. Throw enough work at me still that like i wouldn't you know it wouldn't be like a dramatic. Decrease in the money that i was making. But and he was like you know this has nothing to do with the quality of your work i love working with you you're fantastic. Yara so. To make a long story short what ended up happening is he was firing me and he that was his way of basically like phasing me out of the company and letting me go because from that point. He stopped calling me such emailing me and later on like a couple of months down the road i had to go back into the office because there were a couple projects that we're still. Ongoing with a client took a really long time to get back with their notes and when i was in there i saw that. This guy who. Had worked with us a bunch kind of like. If we needed another producer like if we were to plant we would bring him on to do sort of additional stuff. He was doing my job. So yeah so it just like. It was a really shity way to be like fired without being told that i was fired. And it was just like. That the reason i would like if i could i would erase that from my mind is because i can't really think of another situation that made me feel so like angry and frustrated and just like. In a way that's like. It's still even though this was like you know several months ago feels very unresolved and still makes me kind of like. Angry when i think about it so yeah those very long explanation. A very loyal person. I am. Smart i am organized i. Very like caring kind. I'm conscientious. And i work hard. Man. I think. 2. Be more confident. And. Less passive. To really. Like focus on. What i wanted the things that i know will make me happy and to just go out and get them as opposed to sitting back and waiting for opportunities to prevent themselves. Probably just some of the. Relationships that i formed with people. Just like really. You know. Friendships. You're welcome. Bye. Just just like right before you walked in. I take this off. \n",
      "Food around us. Frank's equipment what does that mean. Awesome lb in harmony. Okay alright sounds good. So i'm going to pull up the virtual human. Sure. Okay. Los angeles. Well. That's a good question. I like the familiarity with everything i know where everything is in the city. That's all i can say right now. So spread out. So hard to get places. Is there anything else. My dream job. I don't think there is a dream job. For me now there isn't one. I'm. Certified employee right now. So am i. Well that's true. Nice sturdy i studied urban planning. Well. I think this some school shooting thing and the nra singing to. Not want to budge on this gun control issue thing. That's it. I try to remove myself from that situation that's annoying me. Gotten better over the years. Most of the time i just tried to. You know walk away are. You know control my emotions in terms of. You know just walking away. Just watch tv now. Jose my children being born. Well i have four children each birth was special and. You know it was. Unique experience each time. What's a lot easier now because they're all adults. But. You always challenging. I would say you seen your children grow up to be successful. And exceeding. Your expectations. Are you worried all the time you worried for him. You know now i'm not around amiss much and i certainly worried about them. Then i found my children. About a week ago. I'm usually. Pretty happy when i see him. Can i have interest. My girlfriend and. Insignificant. No. Around la maybe but that's about it. Excuse me. Why don't i travel. I don't have the funds to do that anymore. Are the health. No. No. Yes. Once about a year.

Kind of a dodge aquino laying around and. Snot feeling myself. About the same. Yes i do once a month. Yeah i do. I do. Well it's you know it's. Can i see a psychologist and. We talked about things i don't really want to elaborate and detail but you know. It's i seem to think that is helpful. Mine i think. That's our question let's move on please. Irritable. Cranky. Yeah it is. Who that's a good question it's been awhile i'd say. Year-and-a-half maybe. Was being alive going on in my life you know i just lost my parent my dad my last parent. So i stuff going on. Leave it at that. I still like sports. Watching a good game or something is. Usually puts me in a good mood particular for my team win so you know i like you at sea. I'm ivan fu that's a freshman. Football player at usc. And i've been a trojan football fan for 40 years so. Why don't you know i think i i listen well and. You know i'm. Pretty much honest and. Straightforward. That's a good question i don't know you would have to ask her. Definitely my mother. But she's deceased now she's been deceased 10 years but she was definitely. Positive influence my entire life. No i have many regrets. Too many to name and number. Bottom you know it. You know you have the the benefit of hindsight and then. Yeah i have a lot of regrets. To listen to the older people in my life. People cared about me and people whose only interest was to guide me in the right direction. Like i said my kids i'm very proud of him. Share my visor. Why. Okay. Easier. \n",
      "Okay great. Everything's all set up. Okay. Okay. 1 sec. Okay. I took a. User. We have this much technology. Yeah. Course. So i'm going to. Kind of spooky. Alright so whenever she. Okay. Yes. Good. How are you. I am from los angeles. Yes. It's the center of everything that you can get to all the places you need to go to. Without having to drive very far. I like being in the city. Well. I also you're dealing with traffic. A lot of congestion. And. Obviously. The environment as far as the air quality is not that great. But you know you live with that. I was a business administration major so i studied business. And. After i finish college ohio. Pursued a career in retail operations. I know as a matter of fact i am not kind of change career. Over the last 45 years so i'm. Concentrating more on the human resources side of the business. A couple of factors. After working numerous ears in the retail business. I am switched over and worked in a. Creative business which is a graphic design firm. And i capture not a lot of knowledge. Innate in the human resource decide because i was. The operations manager slash. Benefits manager for a small company. Yes i'm very happy i did that. I picked up a lot of knowledge and. And is very helpful. Well my dream job is. I'm basically kind of doing what i want to do now because i am a. Independent contractor i do freelance work as an hr consultant using all the knowledge that i gained from previous jobs. And i utilize that with the flexibility to. Do the things i want to do as far as personally and have the time i need to do the things i want to do. And obviously i worked hard. Early part of my career so the. Financial aspect of. My retirement is already set in place so. I do what i need to do as far as maintaining a certain lifestyle. But also i have i also enjoy what i do i'm not under as much stress as i used to be. I'm not. Well i'm not totally outgoing but i'm not i'm not extremely shy i'm. Probably right in the middle maybe more towards outgoing but i'm not totally outgoing i mean. When i'm around other people i am in a social situation are i guess you could consider me an outgoing person but. Obviously i do have my own little private issues that i keep to myself. Oh sure you know i have. Couple years ago i had a heart attack and i had had bypass operation. And had yeah i had to do with stress and things like that i don't talk about that much other than those around me that are close to me. If i meet someone new i don't just openly say well you know. I've experienced this system this i just basically. If it comes up i won't deny it or if it comes up and it just if it i feel like it's something to talk about i will talk about it. What are you doing. Actually. My relaxation is i'm currently living with my mom my mother and she's a senior citizen and she's alone. So what i do for. Relaxation or to relieve stress is actually help her do yard work. Take care of all the gardening and things like that that's actually very. Therapeutic you know. I'm not. Not a. Shortfuse kind of person it takes a lot to get me really angry. So as far as might a concern. There's not there's not much to that. I'm trying to think here. I can't recall when last time it was but it was probably last year sometime. When i am. Had a creditor that i was dealing with. Being very difficult to work with. And i owed money as far as some medical expenses that were incurred when i had my heart attack. A few years ago and. They weren't very understanding of the situation and i i really got a little upset about that because. I felt like i was being honest with them and i was i was more than willing to take care of my issues but they were playing hardball and i didn't care for that. It does. Probably the hardest decision i ever had to make was. It had to do with a life-and-death situation with my my stepfather louis. Battling prostate cancer. Yeah making a decision with my mother whether to proceed with a procedure. That was going to either. Help him there's a slight chance of going to help him even though he's pretty terminal at that point. Or it would be would kill him you know. And that was really tough it was really tough decision to make but. No. I felt like if i didn't try. And see if we could save his help save his life. Or if it we didn't take a chance and then take that extra step. That i would regret it in the long run. It is. I was. Well right now i'm separated from my wife so. She has her issues i have my issues. But we are not divorced we were just separated. And we still have a relationship where we still speak to each other we just don't live together. And the relationship with my mother's really great you know. She's very understanding i'm an only child. So. She likes having me around which is good because she's in her late and she's dinner later stage of her life she's 82 years old. And so she needs to. I guess it's good that and its own way maybe fate is taking place because. You know. Someone 82 years old by themselves in a huge house. Is not a good thing but with me there i think she has a comfort level she feels with me there so she being her only child. Probably the most guilty i feel about anything you are the things that i did. To hurt my marriage. As far as. The things that i did the selfishness i did when i was much younger that. I'm obviously affected. The relationship between myself and my wife. Yeah i am. Got. Caught up in a situation where. I was working tremendous amounts of hours under a lot of stress. My wife was also working a lot of hours in a job that she had. And that we were growing apart. And when she was away my form of release was to go. To the casinos and gamble and saw you know i spent a lot of time in the casinos and what eventually happened was i spend a lot of money. And always see that was a major issue regarding our relationship. How to do a trust because. It was devastating to my wife. I felt when it came to light. I felt very guilty. And i felt less than a human being at that point in my life. No not at all. No not really now. I don't have problems sleeping that's why i don't ever recall having any problems sleeping so no. No. Not at all. No i will i just. The only thing i could say is. After i had my heart attack a few years ago. I don't let i find myself not letting the small details or small things in life bother me as much as they did before. Second to be a little bit more easy-going and my friends and family have noticed that. The last time i felt really happy. Probably when. I had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack. And. He basically said to me that after many tests and many. Months of rehabilitation that. He was happy to explain to me that there was no scar tissue. No major scar tissue that had occurred with my heart because of my heart heart attack. And that time i could count on living a. Pretty much normal life as long as i watch my diet and took my medications. Well i guess number one thing is. My. Physical being itself. I like to be a little bit more healthier lose some more weight. Just in general just be more healthier physically. And as far as mentally. Just not. Go back to those. Ways of thinking where i was doing the wrong things instead of the right things. And not to be so selfish. One-day-at-a-time. You know i just. Try to be at peace with myself and try to have some. Peace of mind on a daily basis. I meditate irene. You know i read some books i watch tv i do things that i know that. I'm if i can i get if i can help myself. I do things to help myself. There's a lot that i regret obviously in my marriage. My working career as far as i had a long career with this. Majors food chain in. And i basically because of my gambling issues i ended up ruining very good career but. At this point right now there's not much i can do i can't change what's been done. So i don't focus too much on the past. I just look at what's in front of me and just focus on what's in front of me everyday. What advice. Wake up and and see what you're doing. Do yourself and you know make the changes you need to be changed. You know i'm not a. I'm not. Someone is not intelligent but i was intelligent enough to know what's right from wrong. Hand. Yet what you doing is wrong you need to change your behavior immediately. Probably. The proud what i'm proud about. Overalls the fact that. I did all these awful things but deep down i don't think as a person. I'm a bad person i have to remember that. When i was caught up in all the gambling and compulsive behavior. It was because i had an illness of compulsive. Obsessive-compulsive behavior that made me ill. And that i was a sick person just trying to become healthy. And every day that's what my life is about it's about recovery and. Just making sure that. I do the right things from the time i wake up in the morning to the time i go to sleep at night. One-day-at-a-time. It's not as hard as you think it's but it is a process where. You need to be diligent about your behavior and your routines. And. Just know that what's not right for you and i could be okay for other people to do certain things but i cannot do those things anymore. What's my best friends can describe me as probably. Easygoing generous. A nice person to be around. And dumb. You know. They were obviously a little shocked when they found out of all my issues. Related to the gambling and the. And the breakup breakup of my marriage which you know it's still not over yet you know. Well my ideal weekend starts off usually. After i have breakfast with my mother early in the morning like around 6. I go to a local park. And. It's about. This park is probably lay down where you can walk up a hill and down a hill. It's about three and a half miles and i take a brisk walk in the morning. Get my blood flowing and get my heart rate going. And then after that i am. Can i go home. Work in the yard a few hours. Take a shower and relax and then. Just kind of kick back for the rest of the day and then the next day. Hi i do the same thing again in the morning i have to go for a walk. Workout in the yard. Watch tv whatever just relax. That's how we can goes for me. Thank you. Bye. Lock yourself out. Okay. It's kind of a guy. \n",
      "Yes i'm okay with this. I'm pretty ass a little tired but. Done pretty good for the most part. On redondo beach. Yep. At the beach like the mountains. Love it go surfing in the morning or snowboarding the day. Highview hiking having these mountains santa monica mountains to beachside. I'd only the traffic. I don't like the congestion a few people here. And i don't like. Price of the cost of living in specific areas. I've been trying to actually. Last year was a sunroof. Really road trip in india now that's my girlfriend. We're looking at augusta rica and hopefully south america this summer and then maybe even doing a road trip. Down the south season the southern states. But i've been at canada been to mexico and ecuador. Been to various states and their. Try to get out there. I love meeting new people i love experiencing new things trying different. Different foods that are native to that local area. And. So far the journey i just i love exploring the cino. This planet we call earth. Just recently went to. She had on can i with a couple friends and. Who's gorgeous we are fluent in seattle. And we saw the city for the first two three days and then rented a car and headed over to vancouver canada and saw british columbian why was he gorgeous. Very lush beautiful trees the. The climate was nice the ocean was right there's. People regret this just a fun trip all around. One of my most memorable experiences. Was probably the. The trip we took the colorado last summer. And me and my girlfriend flew into denver. And we didn't really have a plan we knew we knew of a couple people were living there and. Just the day before we had a. Contacted them and telling them we're coming the area. And they're just your great hospitality they picked us up at the airport lettuce. Crash at their place for a couple days we. Even let us use their car that's for the state and go to wyoming and. See the. The neighbors to the north it was just a great chef great people and. Is just everything worked out very well just everyday was. There's something new and fun. Yeah. I study business management. Anna economics right now. I'm i've always wanted to. Own my own business and i figured mansion pia. Agera foundation to build on and i'll learn more about so i decide to go to manage manchester. See there's a special what it takes for the manager on business and. But economists just to. Just for long-term investment i really want to start running some stocks mets mutual funds and. Cerebellum a foley up so i figured knowledge would be great way for a long-term investment. Financially. So that's why i didn't make nomics. Yeah i'm really stoked was. One of the best decisions probably mine my life. I consider myself more outgoing them. I'm pretty friendly hike don't mind to open up to people and stuff. How to be outside like to go hiking. Want to go. I'm working out the gym but. I most like to be outdoors i love nature and just be outside just. Just puts me at ease. From pretty good for the most part i'm pretty mellow chill. Guy and i do get angry in there. It just lasts for like a couple minutes and before i know it i just it just blows over i don't tend to hold on to things or stay. Angry and hold grudges just cuz. There's no need to life's too short for all that. I can't remember the last time i argue with anybody. I have no idea. Probably when maya. My brother and my girlfriend got a little. Little argument. I like two birthdays ago and it's been awkward kind ever since. I wish you would just handle that. Brighton in the air rather than linda just stretch out as long as it has been it's just awkward for both parties that we should just go to communicate with both of them. Tolna in asset the differences aside and was just communicating. Try to come up with a solution. But now it's just. Awkward. Yeah it does. The hardest decision i've ever had to make. And the tuffy. I don't think i've had too many. Tough decisions really say the hardest decision i've ever had to make on. Maybe. Not moving to colorado for my undergrad. Tier 3 years ago. As long as i think what if. But other than that nothing has really been too tough on my life that. Was really that hard of a decision. Don't really feel guilty about anything. Pretty good person i think and for the most part i can think of any men. So now i could wish i could erase my memory. Nothing really be honest. I love all my memories are usually positive for the most part. I know it's kind of. Weird for somebody to say but. I voted pretty good life and. I'm happy. Yeah. It's cool i'm pretty independent the most part so when i do see him here in the ants. If we go through laundry two times with no contact maybe a couple weeks sometimes even a month. But i want to see units. It's good you know i like to say hi and show my love him stealing. It's not that i don't mean to like not contact them they could always contact me but. It's good for the most part i guess is a young adult. My girlfriend's family. They've been very positive in my life it wasn't for them i think i'd be in a different direction. Just leaving high school i didn't really care about higher education i didn't care about. Really thinking long-term. And i'll just seeing them and. What their family dies in. How they think differently like through higher education and how to get somewhere in life and. See if you do these things this is why i can't lead to. And they've been very successful they own their own oh. Accounting practice and. Seen that influence media. Achieve higher in life. Pretty easy for the most part i just close my eyes and. Wake up in the morning. I'm tired sometimes. It's enzyme a little drained and. Maybe a little groggy in there. And that's it. Showing pretty good for the most part a little. Stressed out justice finals around next week. And i really really want to do well and just seen a close out this last semester and i graduate in two weeks. Anna. For the most part that's that's one thing i'm really nervous about but for the most part i'm really excited and looking forward to going to maui for a week after graduation fired up and fired up to. See what the future holds worrying me my girlfriend 11. Weather chester plan for the sunroom just outside of you don't school for a little while. Yeah. I have never been to dinosaur tsa. I've never been diagnosed with depression. The last time i felt really happy with kashi my girlfriend graduate couple days ago she had just graduated from nursing school on monday. And i just hear what i said and stuff just cuz we've been together for 6 years and cena go through. The nursing program 45 and. It's just the only epsom downs it's really good to see somebody just drive through and achieve what they wanted to even just been really proud of her. Probably outgoing friendly. Positive vibes all around. Adventurist. Love sports. Team player knows how to be a leader in there. And. It's a little outspoken sometimes. Not really the most fart. No not really. Just feeling more motivated right now i'm just. He said i'm just done with school and i'm over at that i just don't feel as motivated. But i just don't need more motivated and determined. Right now and that's not. I'm not going that way right now so. Debbie. How man i couldn't. Can really think of a time. Going caving 2 weeks ago. That was a lot of fun we went up to sequoia national park and i went camping with the. 49cm classes like this a recreation tourism management class and kayden was an elective. And our professor is a world-renowned cave specialist and they took your city's various caves and. Sequoia engine. Me and the strangers are my classmates and becoming really good friends at the end was a lot of fun and rappelling down in a cavs climb back up going through different rooms and shoots. It was a lot of fun. Dallas. 10 or 20 years ago i'd probably say to stay more focused on school. Little less on the social aspects. Hannah. Conestoga from one spore to see how far that he got you. Sometimes not playing hockey hockey sometimes. And that's pretty much at now. I'm proud that i'm really proud that i'm graduating. Play my bachelors and. Looking beautiful time job or get a law firm now so i have something going for me. Really try to be motivated determined person long-term entren thinking eliza more well-rounded person. And i don't want to spoil the world's a proud that i open my eyes to that and now i have different perspectives and. Really about open-minded people and rather than judging i mean on celebrity why not let them do what they want. Anna. I'm really proud to just be a finally get my bashas and hopefully going for my mba in a couple years. You're sure. Bye. Alright house interesting. \n",
      "Jimmy tassi levels are high. How do i get an avatar listen to. Alright. Thank you very much. Yes. Doing okay. Can i cancel. North carolina. Yep. Almost four years ago. I graduated college and internship out here for production company so i started doing that with the group of friends and then got work after that and enjoy the city so much and have been working on here since. Probably. Not the most. Three times a year but maybe twice using the holidays maybe one random trip in there. It's. Ellie's only now just starting to become home to me in the sense of that respect were like i did going home was going home now going home. going back to see my family and seeing some friends but i feel more i feel more like i belong los angeles i do back at home. Add food on the weather goes without saying ifak the resources are like feeling i like that the things i want to do much easier much more accessible here than they would be. In north carolina so it i feel like i'm. Unable to pursue. He loved my passions ambitions in a much more functional unrealistic way living los angeles than i am in north carolina. I mean the cost-of-living isn't great but sometime too i always tell people like part of the rent is having access to so much. Research something resources out here so it's not even expensive new york or boston. So i thought the worst but i also mean is a little bit annoying that every time i do want to go home it's a flying on the drive i can let mean really conceivably. Drive home for the holidays hits better 3 or 4 days and cheer and just not practical so it's unfortunate so far away in that respect but geography. I studied history and media studies and production. Yes i work as a freelance writer and producer. In college i realized i was pretty good at it and i knew there was a way to monetize that and i came out here and worked a little bit in the. Public sector in trying to understand those jobs at weigh-in realize i could. Make more money have more control over my schedule my life if i did it feel and so i've been doing it now for a little over a year now. I do i love traveling. i try to go somewhere new for a good. of time about every 7-day months to try to make something so i was in barcelona just recently. And i'm planning on going to either vietnam or even back to europe in a couple months. Enjoy the break from routine i think that while it's nice to wake up and have a vague idea where your day is going after a few months you can get very much kind of caught at the menu. Pigeonhole is your thought process your expectations for the day and i love going to foreign country and just waking up and knowing that everything i do that day is going to be brand new and will be different than what i would be doing if i was in los angeles er. And my routine so i declare that i love food so it's great to. Just eat a lot of food i love in the places where they were originally created. Yeah sure i went to barcelona has had a few months ago and that was mainly because i had a friend who was living there for 67 months and she kept asking to come out. And i finally i was at the point work i've been working so much for months on end i felt like i deserved a break so i went there for two weeks and he has won the healthiest smartest things i've done in a while so i reminded me again our imported is for me at least 20 to travel into the world. I'm very outgoing i love talking to people conversing. Even virtual people. I lost you. What are you doing. Black sia. Listen play music a lot i like to read like the. Go see movies i cook i cook a lot so i enjoy cooking my girlfriend and i are currently separated by distance so i haven't seen her in weeks and that can be very. Then obviously so i'll talk with her as much as i can but just. I'm a pretty simple taste. I lost her. I don't know if is a mix-up you answer a question and she was like. Are you sure i'll go is outgoing and she has life as a direct response that's okay. Yeah no problem. This is awkward isn't. I don't have much of a temper so very good i guess i don't really get angry easily or quickly and well when i do i'm usually aware of it enough that i can. California wave how i feel and why i'm doing that way and what. I want to be done about it so so it's pretty. Play some pretty easy going guy in that respect. The ponce's probably something petty over like. Misremembering when. Something was done or i get the date on something or like a fact i wasn't anything emotionally field. And it was just about yeah i think it's probably about like. Trying to figure out when exactly we went to san francisco and it wasn't an argument much as just the other person. Thinking other person's misremembering self in reno small or big situations very difficult for me to actually feel enraged. I guess in the classical sense of the word. True think i'm not 114 regrets. How much recently did a project. I got a film and the subject matter had a little to do with like an ex-girlfriend of mine so when it came time to release it. I made a point i can i don't want to send her directly to i want her to think that i was. Doing it to spite her face by did center brother just because he enjoys my working all i said was to see stuff and i. Maybe that she might have could have misconstrued as being passive aggressive i don't know. But i mean that so bad i thought about it i don't really regret as much as like maybe. I could have just let. Everyone else who i wouldn't wasn't so sure about if i should do stumbleupon as opposed to me. Direct me to themself just my thoughts are. Hardest decision i've ever had to make. It was actually probably probably that. He wasn't a hard decision with excel with that. The same ex-girlfriend mission of esperar because i knew i had to. Break up with her after some stuff happened and. Is the focus i cared about her great deal but also seemed to me it wasn't hard to rival the conclusion that i had to. Break up with her the same time to it was not.. The easiest thing to try to go through that process it's going on a roller coaster that you're very much aware of how terrible or frightening is going to be but you know you have to get on the roller coaster so that's probably a recent memory. Just. Abundance for reasons that are this person probably not the best person for me so. That it was a it was i didn't have to i didn't have to weigh too much too much data to figure it out it was pretty clear signing i've no regrets about doing it now. Damn i feel very strongly been about it i felt so i still feel very strongly that i made the right choice down. It can be taken be tough there will be i feel like it's either 55 exhausted myself during the day between work and yeah i've started exercising again which is a huge help. But i but i say that it's i kind of when i get into bed and i never know how it's going to go sometimes it's sometimes out. Wake up within an hour of falling asleep and i can't go back to sleep or. Asia periodically kicking up enough so it's something that's gotten a little better in the last few weeks but i yeah especially having my current girlfriend not around they said she's a very. Big source of comfort around till like that but she travels a lot for work so it's something to have to adjust to and. I sleep can be consumed as a person that but since i'm respecting that someone actually i feel like i don't need too much sleep by. If i can get fined get 4 to 6 hours. Pretty good shape at daiso. How you been feeling. Anxious i guess more just done. Just whenever i get off of the assignment there's always just a question like what am i what's going on next and so far i don't have the next. Project lined up so it's always that nervousness some in the past something usually does come up so we have the precedent of it usual working up until it dies you're always a little. Anxious and angry depressed because it's like a. You know i chose a marshall lifestyle that while i get to have a lot of control in economy over my life it also is all on me in or do it again with sometimes i'm very jealous of. That if you'll just waking up going to the office for 8 hours leaving and not having to think about that work the minute they leave the office and kind of having the momentum of a. Group of people are car company. Carrying them through when it's a little tough forwards like me if i have an off-day if i'm a sick day that no work it's done you know i'm a small business that has one employee. How do i cope with. Them. I assume you mean i guess. You can't work without i cope with the. I made a better answer behind i cope with that lifestyle just i got a much more used to it sometime still learning and figure out how to. How to handle as far as not just like i know what the other how rewarding work is when i do it with all sophia what's the most efficient way to live the life and you know how do i but what's the appropriate way to budget finances what's the. Expectation i should have for myself in a given year wentz realistic what's hopeful and that's something that i'm sure will take years and years to do but i feel like i'm getting better at it then progress right. Yes definitely will once and then. Probably out if i would have gone back. Harris county high school probably logan second time but i'll be on after dinosaurs once i feel like it's one of those things that is something i have to keep in check. Throughout my entire life you know how i feel like i'm pretty happy person for the most part but has they annoying is visible like the sack with people are very creative or people do lots of the mind attends though. Fallen i get that's a self-esteem thing cuz it's so hard to feel. I'm sore so easy i should supposed to get. In your own head about that. This is within a year so i probably was feeling. Awesome just haven't been there before it was kind of easy to figure out. you know it's going to happen again so i feeling the symptoms again. And going through those emotions and feel like okay first i was kind of hoping to be some active kind of working myself. But i'm i realize it's just stupid for me to try to fight the battle of mine so i went in and started seeing a therapist. Really back this is why i just couldn't sleep at all i got to get maybe an hour sleep at night at best, was sleeping at all. Had just no no no drive to do anything whether racino assembles brush my teeth or clean my apartment things like that and just being in the same time simultaneously being aware that's like oh this is all in my head it's not even like that. Sometime so. Oh yeah just a general just a general malaise that comes with depression. I know i just finished up finished up i mean since i can graduate and like that but i got to a point where i felt like. I kind of talk through as much as i could talk through and. I moved on and another place my life isn't kind of good. Good work manakish exit i was working on something i really cared about now with someone i care about greatly and there's such a potential opportunity for me to do not have to worry about the symptoms is half as much now that. I feel like they're p was not necessary also i just didn't have the time to with that much of work goes on some. Oh i definitely i think. Having someone you can confide in who isn't your friend or family member who won't you know have a few drinks and tell someone what you said contemporary like that is definitely something it beneficial i can't imagine how anyone couldn't benefit from having that on. Someone of a routine basis. I don't know i'm i'm coming from believer that all those things like. But things are connecting haunt you are also there for reason like that. My sister died when i was about. Call years old and she was younger than me and watching my parents like seeing my father cry for the first time was a very. Kind of traumatic thing for me in it. I feel like i grew up a lot that day so it's at my house so difficult to see that and see how my parents had to deal with losing a child i don't want to forget those things got think they were very intrical to. How i cope with life and how i perceive. Hardships and obstacles and haven't got image of knowing my father on it's very very humanizing so easy to kind of. You idolized your pants on so idolized my father but you know he's he's a guy like me and as i get older it so easily identify with. The man he is. Sibf 16 or 6. I kind of like the notion that there is a you wouldn't worry as much what people thought about you to realize how people how much people didn't think about you it's really hard to tell a sixteen-year-old and i'm at the point of telling a six-year-old. But i'm bi feel like especially when you're in high school until i guess nowadays you live los angeles where so much is caught up and how people think about you and i still am very by find out someone either is upset with me or doesn't like me it bothers me to a great dealer i hate letting people down so. I'd like to come to help your place we're just knowing that sometimes you can't really control how people feel about you even if you have the best intentions in the world so. I'm very compassionate guy there for my friends i'm pretty selfless that respect i. Have a good humor about thing we even with people with being depressed or depression i can joke about it something you know i'm not a morbid. Depressed more.com aware of when i'm. I'm low and i. Treated as sachin. I don't. Don't try to deny it or try to like. And that's why i. I have a i'm a pretty. A practical person in that respect i don't think i even i'm depressed i'll take it out on people or i don't think people feel totally don't seem too but i mentioned it and going through a depression knowing and i for one feel like when i do go thursday i go everyone can just tell and i'm just a smoking gun. Sadness basically butter no ice in the carrier pretty well in the. I don't i don't lie side of. The reality of. What is happening so. I was on my my girlfriend came to thailand for 3 weeks and then she supposed to go to spain for two but you can't start tripping came back and stay with me for about 10 days and. Yeah i know i love her she's great she's the coolest person i know and so much fun and she. I wish around makes me so happy and. I'm so having her for 10 days and we just had like normal we rarely get normal couples time like it's always like oh i see for 5 days and. Then one of us has to go somewhere i'm so have 10 days is normal we could just cook dinner at home like. Lie in bed and read books really that was great. it makes me so happy that i have. Someone that i can do that within just feels so practical and feel so right. Stretch that i'm i'm a good guy like guy but i know i do not. Don't think i screw people over i don't i'm a good friend to have i'm i'm there for people i look out for people i care. About people and what they think of me and that it was especially much for my friends and. I try to make sure you know it with a lot of my friends being on the east coast i try to carve out time to make sure they know i think about them and i called him. And so i feel like i feel like people who counted their friend them. Probably one of the better ones since the sense that i. I know how much i appreciate and respect the friendships we have. Thanks ali. Bye. Strapped up. \n",

Oh my goodness they're spoiled rotten they have everything. Waking up when my kids were younger on christmas day i loved it. No. Yes. It's been exactly two years and two months. Loneliness depression. Especially after i didn't have any family members left in united states owe. I went to a counselor and then the group therapy. Yes.

Oh yeah i was i participated in the education abroad program at ucla where you go live in another country to learn the language and you live before year after university study of the university. And that it was just a memorable year and experience that i would never forget. Thanks. Probably more shy but the that sometimes i could be outgoing. I'm more shy in terms of unit it takes me it takes time for me to get to know people i mean i'm not a real party person i don't like to go to parties and meet people and things like that. But if i'm among friends and things like that but i can be for the outgoing. With people i know. Drink wine. Neon drinkwine maybe listen to some. Nice music. Pretty good i can i'm pretty good at controlling my emotions. I wouldn't say it was a real argument it was more like a what just the. Russian maybe. About. Finances maybe. Money. I'm just a little irritated. But they're not really. Not really strong emotional. Oh. Well guys. I can't think of anything at the moment skip that one. Maybe. Eating eating more junk food than i admit to. Or. The hardest decision i ever have to make. Maybe. Buying a home buying a home. Or remodeling the home. Spending money for. It was. I felt it was time to move on with my life and to buy a place for myself so i could be self-sufficient and independent. Yes very happy. Then i could erase from them. When i when i was when i was student teaching for a year trying to get my teaching credential and discovered i never enjoyed it i want a race that whole year 1983. It just brought back horrible horrible memories of what i went through when i was student teaching in the discovered that. Teaching k-12 not for me. I stood my major was spanish and linguistics. I was very good on languages and i thought them i enjoy taking them and i was just having a good time taking foreign language and i was getting good grades so i thought maybe this is what i should go into. Foreign languages. I was teaching i was in the delta teacher teaching english as a second language for 30 years and i just recently decided to retire myself. I have a pretty good relationship with my family with my mother and my sisters my father passed away in 2008 and. My relationship with my father wasn't as good as with my other family members. But the on the pothole and we have pretty good relation with the with my family now. Pretty easy i don't have any problems. If i don't sleep well i'm i may be moving around in the bed and. Messing up the sheets but that doesn't happen too often. Pretty good i think i've been feeling pretty good no major health problems or anyting. No. No. Last time i was really happy. I probably when spring break came around and was a vacation time and it was time to go on our trip. Yeah it was a it was a week trip up to central coast to. Cambria and pismo beach and santa ynez. Who's at the nice getaway relaxing on the hotel lawn and garden drinking wine. And enjoying different sites and eating good food and. Been buying wine to replenish our dwindling supply at home. I think she would describe me as. Kind and sweet. Motivated. The nice person. Sometimes i wouldn't mind being a little more outgoing i guess. I tend to be more reserved so i wouldn't mind being more outgoing towards strangers and things with. Really badly about myself. Auxly probably when i betrayed a confidence with some friends of mine when i take them when i tape them singing christmas carols and i. I played it to some other people and they found out and they really laid a guilt trip on me for doing that. But it all got resolved at the end it was just a bad misunderstanding on my part. But it worked out okay. Probably having. Done what i did bikes playing at the other people. What advice. Would i give myself. Timer 20 years ago. Don't give up just keep a keep pursuing what you want and never never give up with. See you there's a. Hell of a disappointment if it doesn't work out. I'm a i'm a good listener. I'm a motivated person i'm hard-working i'm conscientious i'm caring. Simulia pretty happy type person. Something recently when i really enjoyed. Going to the going to the festival of books at usc. This weekend. Yeah books is the festival where they have all these off offers and. They have them food demonstrations and seminars and all kinds of books available to look at and. There's a lots of food and. And lot of authors signing books and things. It's a great event for her to get out and it was nice weather too so it's nice to be out there. I really enjoyed that especially the food. Thanks. I'm most proud of. Most proud of probably. Being successful in my workout in my life and my marriage and. I just basically being happy with myself. Well you're welcome. Bye. But it. Oh okay i wasn't sure if i was supposed to bring it over. \n",
      "Okay. Yes. I'm fine this is a little bit strange you know. Talking to a virtual human. I was born i was born in la i was raised out in the suburbs i've lived all over los angeles live in the valley long beach and now i'm in culver city. There's great food here the weather is great most of the time is lot of sunshine it doesn't get cold i don't have to shovel snow. Third lots of opportunities a lot of diversity all different sorts of people think that's really great. That is a much longer last i would like to get out of here the the traffic i think that's number one i think everybody hates the traffic and everybody's so busy all the time it's really hard to take out together with anybody everybody so devoted to their jobs and then we're sitting in traffic a lot too. I just graduated actually i studied marine biology. I was i went to school and i originally studied graphic design and i found that kind of unfair filling. So i took a trip for awhile traveled around the world and started scuba diving and i realize that i really love marine biology so that's how i got into it. Everybody's been asking me that a lot lately since i just graduated i think i would like to. I think maybe. Managing a. Managing a research. You know i'm not. I'm not really sure i think i would like to. Something in tropical marine ecology maybe like managing a preserve something like that. Hard question to answer. I do. I like meeting new people and seeing different parts of the world. I travel for 8 months in central america. And i visited a lot of different countries i. I was driving. I think i think intolerance injustice in the world. Those are probably the things that get me the most fired up. Brett's my boyfriend does that count. I'm pretty good it takes it took a lot to really get me fired up to the point where i going to blow my top that very few people have seen me angry. To the point where i'm kind of yelling and screaming angry i don't know i just don't get there i think that i'm a little bit afraid of losing my temper so i keep it under control. It was yesterday actually i argued with my boyfriend about getting getting a job i was talking about. Taking a job somewhere and he was being very supportive and i really wanted him to to say no don't go take that job for 6 months cuz i miss you and he was just being supportive so. We kind of argued of health had it was ridiculous so we i ended up laughing and that was the end of the fight. Meditate exercise go out in nature. Unplug it myself away from computer away from technology way from people. I would say not really i'm an only child and it's just me and my parents and we're very very dissimilar for example i'm a pretty adventurous person. And i like learning and my parents are. Couch potatoes a like to watch reality television so we don't have. Too much to talk about or things that we can really do as far as shared activity so you know i love them and everything but there's not too much common ground. Guess i think about our social introvert but i. Seem to. Find most social encounters to be draining where is my my boyfriend for example he. Derives a lot of pleasure and energy from being around people from me it's always a little bit the opposite i have to recharge. Not sure i have a best friend but i guess i'll see my boyfriend he's he's kind of my default best friend. He would probably say passionate intelligence he always tells me that i'm really hard on myself which is true. Dedicated loyal. I think i'm just proud of who i am going to i don't know if that's the answer that most people have but i think that i'm. I'm really proud of who i am i try really hard i've done a lot of things in my life i'm a really good person i think it's kind of rare to find people that are kind and i consider myself. A kind person that that cares about others and wants to make the world a better place so i'm i'm proud of that. No i have not. No. Yes. I was probably about 15 at the time so i think. 17 years ago. Yes. I was cutting and my one of my best friends called. Call my parents and let them know and at that point they took me in for treatment that wasn't the first time i had ever been to a therapist or psychiatrist. But before it was more they thought i'd 80hd so. It was i think my parents really took me in rather than me seeking help. I haven't for about 3 years i stopped because it felt like i was check in with a parole officer i just wasn't enjoying the relationship i had but i still have a psychiatrist that i go to for med checks. I do think it's useful if you have the right therapist i think if you don't have a good relationship you have therapist you can be incredibly harmful. I have. Talk to people that have had bad experiences and and won't ever go back. Lately i've been a little bit down just a little bit more down than usual because i graduated and my routine of go to school. And do school things 24/7 has come to an end and without the routine it's been a little bit. Weird finding out what to do with my. Finding a way to be productive and knowing what to do with my time. It's also been a little bit. Depressing finding out that my intelligence and good grades in school doesn't translate to real-world skills and there aren't that many jobs for marine biologist. California. Almost impossible ever since i was a little kid i had a i had trouble falling asleep and. About four years ago it became really really bad where i just couldn't sleep through the night i was getting about 4 hours of sleep sometimes i would wake up every hour and i wake up in the morning just to complete reckzo. For about 4 years i've been taking trazodone so i can sleep. Have you ever seen fight club your virtual human so you probably haven't seen that but. It's it's pretty much like that i. I'm just a complete panic anxious reggae. I lose my ability to deal with. At least my ability to deal with things are much more likely to lose my temper. I can't regulate my moods i'm just. Really volatile. Probably few months ago i think that i may have been on a trip gone away for a weekend and forgot to take my medicine with me. Or. Something like that and then i can't sleep and stuff what happens. Really happy i mean. Easy for me easier for me to keep track of when i feel really really bad really happy i guess i felt happy on new year's really happy on new year's eve which was. 10 days ago i was with my boyfriend and some friends and we took a trip out to palm springs and joshua tree and it was really nice to see them. I don't get to see them very often because i've been in school and i've been so busy it was really nice reintroduction to. Re-life. I think that i am i'm kind of inconsiderate i'm taller and i'm pretty open-minded. I'm wearing my faults. I just try to be nice to everybody and. I'm very curious about about the world and things that i don't know about i really like to learn. The top of my head first thing that came comes to mind is diving the blue hole in belize it was really. Amazing it was me and my friends we just. You have jumped off the boat and you come up over the edge of this limestone sinkhole and its really really really blue and you just drop down to about 140 feet in. Something like 2 minutes we did it pretty quick not everybody could do it that quick and as you go down then you see all these stalagmites and stalactites and they're huge they're larger than a human at cuz it's this cave system. And it's really murky and there sharks swimming around 2 or so. Those pretty good. I'm trying to remember that the moment i haven't had much free time last three and a half years being in school reading hiking being together with my friends doing. Relatively. Loki things going to movies having dinner parties cooking. Playing with my cat. Not that i can really think of i'm sure i've made mistakes in my life but you know i'm still here so. Can't be that bad. I know hang in there hold onto your clothes cuz the 90s are coming back in fashion. Cloudy weather. Beautiful sunsets being in. Being out in nature. Kind of being away from the hubbub of the city. Getting good grade. I think my boyfriend has he's just especially the last year he's. Really inspired me he quit drinking he quit smoking he's made a lot of positive changes in his life and i know that those things aren't. Ark hard or arteezy i should say so to see someone overcome that. Really inspired me. Okay. \n",
      "Okay. Okay. Death. Okay you. Inglewood california. Yeah. No. That's okay. You made my girlfriend and my daughter. Yes. Arrow case okay cool. Yes i do. Welcome football recruiter so i travel. All around the world to. Define different football players for sports management company. I'm just the independence about it being alone being able. To be free and not tied down to one. To one thing you know. Great. I'm i remember traveling to. And take them to clubs and this and that and we're not that type of organization. Yeah. Dishonesty i don't like when people are. Dishonest that really really really bothers me. And not. True not honest not real. That that upsets me. I tend to just. Try to free myself from the situation to tear my mind usually take a walk or something like that or just. Just go in the room by myself and try to pair my. I'm okay with it at times. But i can definitely be better. Oh. I already argued with my. Milady a couple. Days ago and it was about. Our daughter in summer things she's doing in school and. Chichi wants to raise her one way and i think. I want a razor a kind of a different way and discipline. Her a little more uncertain situation so i think different disciplines. A big key in a kid's life and chichi. She was raised a little differently. I don't know just. Angry upset. You know when you're in argument that's what you feel so. He doing say things that. Dad. That bother you and. You go on with it. Yeah a little bit. I don't know i just. Just the way i feel i don't know i can't. A little. A little. I don't know just. Realness. Honesty. Truth. Spin. Straight out front. I'm pretty close pretty close with my family. Oh hold on the subject. They're raised different. Society's going to become even wilder what the way the kids are raised and no discipline and. The things they're doing everything we. They live and everything's inflated so much to wear. It's a skin to a point where it's getting out of hand i think kids these days. To a certain extent. Or much wilder than i was in. And generations before me and just able to do and say and. The lack of respect in. Analogous. Education-wise is this. I think it's just tough times for kids and in the way they act. It's it's ridiculous to me. I definitely like to watch sports. I like to gamble i i like to travel but i can skate. I like. Kind of like a. A guy that likes to see different sites and go different places like that. I'm a big movie person so i like going to theater stuff like. What's your dream job. I'm actually living it. I always wanted to be in in some kind of sports industry and that's what i'm doing now i just. My goal was to get. A little higher and a ladder and. In all my own sports management company but i'm doing pretty well for myself so. I'm happy. Yeah. No. No. No. It's okay it's just pretty easy. Irritated. Tire. I don't know it's been awhile. Wow. Couple weeks ago. How would you say. No not really. I think. He would describe me as a stand-up guy i try to be. A good loyal friend and. And then adult. Thank you would describe me like that. School went to school grow up together i've been knowing all my friends for. Pretty much all my life. Yeah. A very close match. My friends. And i are very close. With pretty much do a lot together still at this age. I'm honest loyal very loyal. I am a hard worker i think i am. Tutoring sitting i'm just. Not the average guy i'm pretty much i'm a different different breed i just. Carry myself and act a little different from a normal guy. I don't know just how i was raised and high on my dad was kind of different. He didn't. Go within the crowd and. I think i learned that from emma lawton. And it's just. It's it's. Kind of. Same path i took. Yes a lot of things i regret. I regret. A lot of decisions in my life. Yeah one. I actually. Let a lady of my life goal years ago that i thought was my soulmate and. We had a big argument and one thing led to another and we decided to take a break and then that break i. I start dating somebody else and i told her i'm going to go my way and she go away i think there was a big. A bad decision very bad decision. Yeah totally i think i should have took a step back and really just thought about the situation a little. More instead of a. That's why i said moving forward. I just upset i tend to get upset and then my thoughts create cloud at so. I need to think a little more when i'm upset. I don't know just. Experience in time. Do you know make it. Making up for your mistakes and end. Being better about. Different decisions after you made the mistakes. Think a little harder by situation about. Situations in. And things and the decisions that you make. Back a lot longer and harder before you may come in i think the outcome will be in a little. Today. My grandmother she's always been. A+ lawrence she's a great black woman. I'm with old-school. The ways of living so i think i i've added that to my life. The great woman. And baseball and. Yeah.

And that's what i wanted to do so i accomplished my girls who at the time was a great. A great thing and still does a great thing it's a great accomplishment of my life. Accomplishments being able to fire. If i'm. Have a gold ore. Or something i'm supposed to do that week or that day and i compliment it always puts me in a good mood or getting my job done and out the way i'm supposed to do it in this in a timely fashion always with me. Being a positive role model right now for younger kids that's in our sports academy program my i think as i got older. The thought process in. The way i look at life is totally changed and. I think i. The lot of kids can look up to me that i deal with now and say you know that somebody that. That is is a pot of positive on to my life. Oh. Couple days ago my football team. Or in the playoffs. How so. Always makes me happy. Thank you. I get. \n",

Sorry. \n",
      "Thank you. Yes. I'm okay. Los angeles. I don't know. Kind of dirty but that's to be expected from a big city. My the last class i took was a sociology class not really sure where i'm going with school but i'm thinking about sex education. I think that is a really important job. I feel like. Because there's kind of a. Stigma i guess. About talking about sex at leads to like a lot of unsafe sex and love unplanned pregnancies so i feel like it's a very important job for. The world. I don't know. No. Lack of funds. It depends on the people but i'd say that generally more shy. Of course the people who i know well. Likes for closer to me i am more outgoing. What are you doing. Play with my dogs. I don't know if it's a nice day i'll go for a walk. If it's not a nice day then rapidly cold out or something then. Maybe watch a show on tv i like or read a book or something. It's a pretty good at controlling my temper. I can't remember i think the last person i argue with. Was my boyfriend. Probably last week but i don't even remember what it was about. I don't think i really feel guilty about anything i say that i regret things but i think there's a difference between. Guilt and regret. Mike and guilt is more just like feeling bad. But regret is like. Feeling like you should have made a different decision and. I think that can help you in. To make better decisions in the future or his guilt you just feel bad for no reason and it's useless. I regret not doing better when i was in high school. I mean not getting better grades. I regret. Blake getting involved with certain people in the past. But i mean i'm not sure that's about it that i can think of right now. Yeah i mean i mean in the past. Yeah i could have made. Different decisions. I mean obviously some things you know you aren't entirely in your control but i'm not going. Just feel not going to regret things that i had no power over so. I'm not sure if i would want to erase it from my memory. But. I wish that it didn't happen to me was a time that i was raped. I can't really think of any hard decisions. I can't think of any. I'm not sure i can't think of any. Tell me about your. I have a pretty good relationship with my family. Not. I wouldn't say that i'm really close with my mother but i mean we get along well and i'm very close with my sister we're basically best friends. I think that my mother has been a positive influence in my life. Because she was always able to provide for me and she always. She didn't i mean to me like mistake sometimes but i think that she was always there for me when i needed it. And. She just did her best to raise me so i think she was a big positive influence. It's been easy lately sometimes i have trouble sleeping but. Lately i have had no problems. It depends how long i've gone without sleep i can just. Be anywhere from lake. Groggy to lake. Really on edge. And like. Extremely tired. I have been feeling. Pretty good. I have like general anxiety kind of all the time but it's not as bad as it has been. In the past. So. I'm feeling mostly pretty good. I think that i've actually been feeling. Happier lately. I wouldn't say that i'm like. Really happy all the time i mostly just kind of. Like. Neutral but i have been feeling more positive. Lately. I'm actually not sure if i have been diagnosed with ptsd. I know that i've been seeing. Psychologist for like. Since i was 16. For depression. And i think my first psychologist to ace offer few years. Thought that i had ptsd but i'm not sure if she. Ever made a diagnosis. I'm not sure. I don't know. Yes. It's helpful to. Talk someone and have them kind of. Guide you in. Talking about something so that you can figure things. Figure out your feelings about things sort of i guess for yourself or like why it helps to talk with somebody because you can figure out why you're feeling a certain way about something. I mean. I think sometimes you can do that on your own butt. Talking to somebody helps i think. Not sure. I'm not sure. Not sure. I think i would spend it mostly. At home. But it would be sunny out and i would go outside a little bit. And and play with my dogs and. I probably have my boyfriend over. I eat food that i like. Like only through that i like like my favorite foods. Watch. Movie or tv show that i like. Just. Kind of have like a relaxing time but. That's nice. I would tell myself to. To to do better in school because throat high school is kind of an underachiever. And i ended up going to community college like on and off because. I would like. Sort of lose interest and then. Not do well. Are as well as i could have. So i would tell myself to. Do as well as i could in school because they feel like i am capable of a lot more. Then i do. And i think i could easily have gotten a scholarship if i have done well in high school. So i just told myself to do good in school and. Probably wore myself about one or two people that. Turned out to be not worth my time. I think i am. Proud of myself for not. Being. Better and for wanting. 2. I am kind of bitter at yes but i guess i'm proud of myself. For not being selfish and wanting to. Make the world a better place like cuz a lot of bad things have happened to me and i tried to instead instead of dwell on them. I try to. Or i want. Tech be able to make things. Better for other people. And as much as i want to help i guess. Empower people to make their lives. Better. \n",
      "Okay. Sure. I'm well thank you. Southern california. The weather. The mountains the ocean. Traffic. Air quality. No. Not a lot. Time. Money. I studied art. Studio art. It was just always a a talent and a desire i had from childhood. I am. Making. Record living through my art. It's challenging. Well. I need it's about having the time. And finding. An itch that appeals to. Others while being able to do work that stays true to my own vision. Somewhere in between. I read. I. Walk dogs. I spend time with my family. So it's very good i love my family very much and they loved me very much we were very supportive of each other. Pretty good most of the time i'm not. So great when i'm dealing with a lot of rush hour traffic. But it's not out of control. I don't really remember i want to say it was probably my daughter and it was probably about something stupid little. Stupid thing. My daughter is some. 39. Beautiful. Brilliant. Very talented feria. Goal-driven. My son is 27. He is more laid-back. Very sweet. And. Starting to. Be a little more goal-driven. A little less satisfied with just the daily grind. Being a parent is some. Very challenging. In a wonderful way. I think the hardest thing is is fear and worry for your children. Today's world can be very. Violence and scary and you fear for your children's safety and well-being. I'm sorry. Oh gosh. Sprint at the close friendship you have with your children the. The love. T support the joy of just. Everyday little things that you share. Oh. Well i'm i. Talk to my children about anything and everything we have very open communication. Which in my parents generation i think children warm or seen and not heard. Well. With my daughter my first child i was young and inexperienced not only in being a mother but. Naive in a lot of ways regarding life in general. And i think probably. Most parents. I have regrets. Situations they may have had their children when they were. When they were young that. Weren't the best. Sometimes i feel that i should have. Ben. More aware. At a younger age. Just just. Decisions and situations that decisions you make situations you find yourself and when you're younger. Out of being naive and and. I even though logically i know that. It's something that couldn't be avoided at the time. You know as you get older you hindsight is 20/20 you could older you you look back and wish that you. Had even more in top of your you're. Your life when you were younger. Oh gosh. I honestly can't think of anything. I don't know that i would want i can take him in advance i don't know that i would want to erase it from my memory because. I feel that we learn from. Everything. And that there's i don't want to lose the lesson that i'm to learn. From that experience. Positive influence in my life my daughter. My son my granddaughter. There's only enough an author carlos castaneda. Just my my family's been a positive influence because of their love and support and. In reading carlos casas natives works i find it he. Has a brilliant mind. And because i've. Practice some of what. He talks about in his books. And experienced them. As being authentic. Whereas some people. Do you know. Question has validity i found it. He has something very. Extraordinary to offer. Mankind. Pretty easy. Fall asleep pretty quick. No not really just always looking for the next 2. Project 2. 2. Get started on. No. No. Yesterday yesterday was mother's day. And my children gave me flowers and beautiful gifts and made me a wonderful brunch end. We spent the day together and it was very very nice. Oh. Easy going. Easy to be around. Friendly happy. I would like to work on. Being. More. Focused. On. On projects. I'm gosh. Probably when i was a kid. We know kids can be. Kids can be cruel to each other. So nothing that. I still. At this age. Take personally you know hold a grudge for. Sure everybody has regrets but. You do the best you can do at the time and you learn and you move on. I don't know i i can't answer that one. Oh gosh. I read a great book the last couple days and i've been working on a new painting that. I'm really pleased with i like the way it's going. My kids. But the fact that my kids are. Wonderful human beings i feel very blessed. Goodbye. Well that was interesting. Should i take this off. \n",
      "Yes. I'm doing well. California. I like the weather i like the people. I don't like the traffic that's primarily it. Sociology. It's a topic that just really interested me the most out of all the other subjects. Now. To be a writer. I like being able to write what i want to write right now i write things that i'm not really that interested in. Like articles about. Teenager culture. Stuff like that. I think they have it pretty easy and i know how easy they have it. No not really. Depends on the situation or who i'm around when i first meet people i can be shy but if it's someone i've known for a while i can be outgoing. What are you doing. I'll lay down or trespasser like deep breathing. Just maybe do something that's kind of fun in my numbing like watch tv. I'm pretty good i don't really let anger show that much. I'm not like a i don't have a fiery temper or anything like that i'm pretty rational. I actually can't remember when last time i argued with someone was cuz it's been so long. Because i feel guilty about the fact that i don't talk to my grandparents as much as i should. I'm close with my grandparents but not really anyone else in my family. Cuz they basically serve raised me and my parents. Really in the picture that much. I can't really think of one. Right now. I guess when my sister died it was really traumatizing. Yeah. Yes. Is the hardest decision i've ever had to make is deciding whether or not to divorce my husband. Because we weren't getting along and there was no reason to stay married but i still felt like i should stick it out. I mean it was hard at the time but. I made the right decision i think. My grandmother was a positive influence from young age. She's just a very strong powerful. Through staunch character that rubbed off on me. Not really super easy. I sort of i mean it's probably my fault i go to bed too late. Just heard a foggy and distracted. Trouble concentrating. You mean like my body. Normal sign. No complaints. Insane as ever. No. No. Last night i was just hanging out with my friends and was just having like a really good time sharing stories and laughing and stuff. Probably funny and easy to get along with but also caring. Send your idea. I spend my ideal weekend not really doing much like maybe just sitting around reading or going to the movies watching tv. No i don't think. I don't think i think regretting things is a waste of time. Don't. Try to. Don't go out of your way to try impress people. They like you than they like you. Sometimes. Sometimes i can be kind of lazy. I'd like to have more of a laxative. Better work ethic i guess. Just sort of putting off stuff. Until you know right when it's due or after its do things like that procrastinating. Sometimes for the things that i write people will write negative things about me like in the comment section on a website. That'll make me feel bad. I'm articulate and funny. Good friend. I guess i'm most proud of the fact that. I. Unsatisfied with. Myself. And my friends and my status in the world. I'm proud of the fact that i feel comfortable with it. I'm just hanging out with my friends. Sir people watching. Watching a movie that's good. Listening to music. \n",

Annoying people rude people. People that drive. They just have no consideration for others. I swear a lot. Oh i'm alright i get mad once in awhile. It was probably my daughter she's 21 almost 22 she's probably she is lives at college but comes home on the weekend and she was probably a room was probably a mess. The same fight we've been having for years. May i do. It's better now that we don't live together all the time though. Anno. I guess making the right decisions likes. Burnt started out when she was little about education the right school to go to. The right activities to do. Setting a good example. Being a good role model. Everything my kids are the greatest joy of my life i love them so much. And you just get so. I'm in richton fulfilled by them and when the kids are little you see things through their eyes which is exciting you want to share everything with them. I have an older son. Who's the financial analyst and then i have a daughter in college she's a liberal studies majors going to be a teacher. A business. Oh yes. I'm an office manager. My dream job wow that's hard. I don't know i like my job. It's good i like the people i enjoy it. Fun. My son told me they're called the teacup generation because they're fragile. And i think they're. Pens in the asses most of them. Not for a while. Maybe a month ago. I have a new boyfriend and things were going. Really great. Now they're just going it was great now it's just okay. I guess the newness wore off. It's hard. Retard. I don't really. I'm sorry. How do i know them. I don't know what you mean by them. Okay. No. No. Yes. Oh i don't know you're so. I just didn't feel well i just couldn't i just didn't feel right i couldn't pull myself out of it. Yeah. Oh just sad and just lack of energy and didn't really wasn't really motivated didn't really wasn't really my happy self. Therapy yes. I do. Well not that many chat i still don't feel that great but i just it's good to talk to someone and tell them how you feel. Even if it's just to get something off your chest. Tired sad. Depressed blue. No i'm just not happy. I don't feel good and i'm not happy. Don't just. Stay stay to myself don't go out with friends as much as i used to. It's very hard. Terrible i don't sleep. Thank you. Crazy distracted. Just. It's hard for me to cope with things easy you do mundane things are just difficult. Well being around my kids is fun. We went out to my son. My son and daughter-in-law and my daughter and i went out to have hawaiian food got together always. Fun to get together we got together at my house on christmas i enjoy just getting together with them. No. I'll take better care of my health i guess. I don't know. I don't know. Who are my daughters. Pretty positive and upbeat and. My my parents are both gone but. They were pretty positive. I suppose going on a trip to canada with my daughter was very memorable. We flew to detroit where i have my best friend lives there and then we stayed with her then we went from. We drove from detroit to through canada niagara falls and we went to buffalo where she's from. And we she has three girls and my daughter was i think i don't know if third fourth grade something like that. It was just fun for all of us to get together and do things. Exactly like her we're outgoing or outspoken we tell like it is. We. We're high-energy people. If a lot of anxiety. We like to do a lot of the same things. I don't know about 3 or 4 weeks ago. Well. I save it my feeling is attributed to whether i don't like cold weather and i'm not comfortable at all in it. And whenever the weather changes i sorta get down. Well i'm funny. I'm hard-working. I'm i care about everyone. I'm a very kind compassionate person i have sympathy for. For everyone. And i'll reach out to someone that i see in a store anywhere that needs my help. I suppose raising my kids. And the good people they've turned out to be. Bye. \n",
      "Yeah. I'm doing okay. How are you doing. I'm originally from cyber valley from the san gabriel valley. I like the diversity i like the vibe of the city i've lived other places and sis. Not. As happy here and feel like i can really thrive here so. Waikele. Like all the things. Are so close together and there's a lot of interesting things are totally different parts of the city just miles away from each other. Don't like the traffic don't like all the cars. But i can live with it i mean. There's not that much i don't like. Aesthetic music vocal performances study music technology. Things like that. Yes. Right now. I sing an opera company. About my i do have a day job because it doesn't pay that much unless you're actually working for the la opera. So i'd ever date. we work at a call center that caters mostly to. Performers and actors and things like that it's really good because i get a call i can. Call in and change my shift very easily. That's actually pretty good gig. I do some technology gigs. Sometimes. Sjsm recording some live sound stuff but i'm kind of want to get away from that. Listen video work sometimes but again i want to get away from that don't go back. Because if i end up performing more is more interesting i liked being talent where they like being crew. So. Kind of want to get away from that side. Start working more toward actually doing what i want to do with my life. Sometimes mean repair my personal life yeah. Did you have a shout i put out there to deal with people. But if i'm at home rather just keep to myself or my husband or my cats or whatever. Talk to family. Don't really have too many close friends. But yeah you know. Rather keep to myself. A moderately close to the family that i have laughed about you lost a lot of family in the last 10 years or so. But like. Thank you but like my. I'm close to my husband. I've got a couple of cousin i talk to you and my aunt that i have an aunt that i talk to you a bit but it's not like. Interacting everyday close together. But it's. Somewhat close. Mostly i saying already read or write or. Hangout try to. Clear my mind of all thoughts sometimes it doesn't work but. Try to do that and try to. Clear everything and see what starts coming back in. Sometimes that works sometimes it doesn't. But mostly creating things. Contacting my family. Sonia. Do facebook or whatever. Works but. Most of my free time i. Create things. I like to travel more i travel by car a lot. Amaya tia of. Like having a birthday celebration would be to go on a road trip. I like to travel more. I'd like to travel for work things or whatever but i don't get as much an opportunity as i would like to travel. Co predictably traveling by car seeing like the landscape change seeing people. Change saying you're feeling the vibrations of the area change. Seeing what's out there. And i know that there's a bigger world outside of. Where i am and where i live in my world i like to see that. But i like to leave that to go back to my world. Ieee like to take us to make the drive from here. To nevada weather. i go all the way to vegas or just go. To stateline. My cousin and i would take what we call. Exit one trip because once you get to the first exit of a highway you're either in another state or you're at the end of the highway. She would take those we just. Sort of impromptu would like a day or two notice just move things around just take off. So those are actually trips that i like may cuz i take off and then just come back. Sometimes the same day sometimes overnight. Small short trips that. I'm very involved but you just get to go and you see things and see how. The desert landscape looks in different seasons how people react. In different times of the year in different areas. Too close to home but not. But not close to home close to home but it was still a world away. Cuz i don't really have time to take like a two-week vacation or whatever. Precious little things at. Kind of put things back in perspective and clear my head things like that. Mankiller server sense of. Meditation and then that you get on a highway that shouldn't get driving the freeway. So i. Like doing that. The last time that happened. Was may of last year. Able to do that. We actually my aunt came over with my cousin who's. 10 years younger than i am. We kind of grew up like sisters. And i was about to move away from. Be inland empire which is where they live. Sakana took me on a last hurrah we drove up to vegas. I looked around and came back cuz i actually. Lived in vegas for a while but i don't like it. So they kind of. I saw each other some of the locals sites around there. And i came back and was. An overnight trip but we're driving the entire time. It's kind of interesting. Things are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or two children or the animals people who can't fight back. They're mean to them just because they can't fight back. And. Actually. Like to see people who are. Stay strong as a people who are being mean. Standing up. And being. An advocate. Or what have you. So i think that's one thing it's makes you really mad just being cruel or mean for no reason. You're not true for people who can't fight back a few people who've done nothing to deserve it. That kind of really just makes me mad. But i'm annoyed i'll try to just walk away from the situation. And if the situations to start following me then i'll. Wind-up. Laughing out somehow either. No verbally just. Cutting them with a clapper. You know. Really just i really will yell at somebody. But i'll try to. If i try to walk away and diffuse it if that doesn't work they don't let them know that they're annoying me and get away from. Not like legal trouble or anything because usually i'll find a way to. Get them to leave me alone. Not really like. Big trouble but. Cuz it cuz it's it is off-putting and it's. Not expand expected reaction. And that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reactions i know that will work and get people away from me. Does not really. In trouble and if. It's. Is trouble a tuesday trouble that. It's from mad that other person's perspective and doesn't affect me at all because. Do the situation i can get out of. So as long as they leave me alone. I'll walk away from it. The last time i argued with somebody. Like. Hurt like a pervert like a family member or an outsider. Somebody not. The last thing i could think of was. A. Argued with. My husband about the care of my mother-in-law cuz she's got dementia. And so we. When the reason we came out here from van lennep i was to take care of her she won't go. Anywhere but la. When she is like hardcore angeleno like we know we are aware that in our nature. But we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere. But so we came out here to take care of her. And he wants her to be able to stay in her. In her apartment i want her to move in with us. Because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her. If she lived with us. But she wants to stay where she is. Cuz she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process. But he wants her to stay where she he wants her to be able to have what she wants cuz he's a mama's boy like. I am i'm a mama's girl you and i lost my mom like four years ago i'm still a mama's girl. Enough standing still. And i know that. It. Briggs you. A sense of satisfaction to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much. That's what they wants you want to get it for him. Because you know that happened. When you were going up with me try to. Give you what you want because you wanted it. And you want to do that for them now they started giving back to them somebody that you care about me you feel deserves it. But it's kind of dangerous for you know i don't want this thing to happen to her. Yet i want her to remain. Who she is for as long as you can so i know. Disease that she has is going to erase who she is eventually. And eventually she will have to be put in. A place where they can give her 24-hour. Medically trained pear. But until then. We can we can handle it you know amongst ourselves it's not that bad. But it's getting worse she really should has no business living by yourself anymore. So the solution right now is he stays there most of time with her and i go back to our house and. Is it gets stressful and it gets annoying because his. I do. I handle the outside things are run the errand to take her to the store things like that he does the day-to-day things. Make sure she has she eats make sure she. Yeah. Have clean clothes things like that. So amy is a partnership pizza. It's. A dual effort is very much adequate effort. But i would like her to move in with us so that was that's like. A source of not really like yelling screaming argument but. Lively discussion. Intubate. Not insurmountable mean life's not going to be easy ever. And if it is a 20 should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you. So as long as you're on top of things your present your life's not going to be easy. You deal with it and move on. The most positive enough to think of ben probably my mother and my grandmother. Cuz my mom was pretty much a single mom. And my grandmother helped raise me and they actually. Gave me a lot of confidence. And but we're realistic about it. Sunday night. Think i have sort of a. Realistic server. Downer temperament to myself that they that they. Help me see that it's just. In me and it's not something i can't get over. And that you know life's going to go on you know my mom would say to me. When you're forty or fourty whether you working at mcdonald's or doing what you want with your life. I think that was a big influence and how i have lived my life since she's passed. I regret. Not taking care of myself in the last year my mother's life because i think i may have clouded some of my decisions. No it do have underlying conditions everybody my family is diabetic i didn't take care of that when she was. Last year for life. Cuz too busy. Wanting to get her home. My focus was to get her home. So i didn't eat right i didn't take my insulin right. I wanted making myself insulin-resistant that that year just because my blood sugar was so high 48 like a year. Eating just horrible foods. When i did eat. So it really took a toner really actually made myself very sick. And i'm wondering what if i didn't. If i would have taken care of myself and i had my head on completely straight my my. Vision in my thoughts weren't completely clouded. Would i have made some better decisions on her behalf. Especially when she needed them. What you needed me to be to step in and make this his far because she. A wind-up having a health catastrophe. She had kidney which had kidney damage. I want to be kidney failure and. Her health insurance provider missed that. So she wanted having. Start of this whole. Catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down. She wanted having a stroke at like 50. 1. She had a small stroke. And it just kind of went down from there. Something while if i didn't if i had taken care of better care of myself would have been able to take better care of her. And i know. There wasn't anything i would have been able to do to prevent her death what i say if i would have been able to make it easier on her. If i would have taken care of myself that's like one huge regret that i have. Oh i know i am but it's. My desire to take responsibility. For everyone and everything that i care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine. And i know other people i can't really. Direct them. In my own vision because they're their own. Individual beings. And they can't. Yo. Be what i want them to be and i know they're not going to be. But i still have you know my ideals. And i want the way i want everything to go and i went every. Buddy that i care about to be happy and to. Be able to. Fit into my life. In a way in. The best way possible. Other beans. And i'm not going to be able to do that for them then i can build you up for me but it. Still buy ideals. I have to sometimes have to look at it going well. Is this what i want because i want it or what. Is what they want and what. There isn't their decision or mine and she said it's theirs. I know it's there so. If you really care about somebody you're just going to support them and go with them but. It's still. Kind of hard. For me and i know i got to get over it. 10 or 20 years ago. Probably to have been more. Assertive and starting my own life. Because i want up taking care of my mother means she. Got sick. Literally the weekend i graduated from college. I'm at a job lined up and had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her. I think would be more aggressive about starting my own life getting a job outside. The house in addition to caring for her. Getting my own. Job history mount credit history thing like to think like that built-up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about 10 years. So. I think i probably would have done that. Potomac. Do that. Ikea. Who you are and learn to separate. You're who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family. You keep a sense of yourself that's probably. What i would have induced things for yourself to keep that you sent of yourself. Giving myself. 10 years ago. No. No. No but probably cuz i haven't. Condo doctor about it cuz i don't want to know. I mean it's not. I know. There were times in my life where i've been severely depressed since usually. Circumstances. And had to pull myself out of it. But i'd rather pull myself out of it for resorting to treatment. After my mother had died. M been this long battle. 4 year that we lost. I didn't know. If i if i was to blame for that it's like logically knew i wasn't. But. How can i convince myself of that. Two weeks after she died i want up with. Pulmonary embolisms. And one in each long because. I didn't take care of myself for year. If you're all i'm 30 years old if. Whatever i do to myself i can get over. No turned out no. But. I want up having to take more medication. Because of that. Yeah it's been a fight to get my own house back to get. To be able to. Get out of that depression cuz so much my life was based on being my mother's daughter office and i didn't. It's like. The rug was pulled out my. Fontana my world after that. So. That was the pretty pretty much sent me into a deep depression i'm. I almost got divorced because of it because i. Didn't want anything anymore. So. And i was being really distant for my husband by then at that time we're married for about 2 years. At that point. I started getting very distant from him pushing everything away just. And feel what am i going to do with the rest of my life now. Ben. A fighting are you be there times i know i couldn't get up. Stay in bed and sleep all day. No. But then. You realizing that. When my mother died i had. Forecast like after 2 or mine to rehearse. Si1 adopting the two that were hers. They don't have a choice of whether. They can go out and get their own food and get their own supplies. I took that responsibility of doing it for them. So that was one motivating factor was at. Didn't have a choice. Of whether or not i was going to get up and. Provide for them i mean i could go without eating i could go that taken care of myself but they couldn't. Didn't know so. They are they actually. Got me up and. Made me go out and face things even though. Didn't want to ditch didn't just kind of want to curl up and. Died but that would have been my choice not theirs. And they i mean what would happen to them. If i was never take care of them. They would have been. Said to a shelter whatever probably. And maybe they would have not been re-adopt me home and adopted by somebody else maybe they would have been killed for. For me means for me. Making. Selfish decisions. So it's like i need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed. Nuts. Acumen a motivating factor is. Cuz i figured out that. It was just me i'd be able to live without a lot of stuff in my car if i wanted it wouldn't be big deal i wouldn't care as long as i was doing what i wanted with my life. But. I have a family to look after now. So i have to go out and do things. You know i have to go out and. Look for legitimate work you know dayton your day job i have to let you know. But i'm trying to strike a balance between the two because his. What i want to do with my life but yet i have to take care of my family some. Morgan. A balance of the two. Very. But it's worth it. I mean. It would be very. I have a lot less things to worry about if i just looked at my car and said forget it. But. Keeping. A residence down paying bills things like that. It's difficult but you have to do it. If you want. You want any if you ever want anything in your life you have to go through that. And i know that. But. It gets hard. Sometimes you do want to give up. But then. It's like well what's the alternative. I mean i don't think i could live a comfortable life. If i did i wouldn't do anything. I have to be slightly uncomfortable or not going to do anything with myself. I'm just going to. Be content just hang out all day stay in bed hang out with my cats or whatever. And it wouldn't get anything done. A very. Anxious and nervous and. Mean what if. I don't find. Enough. Went off work to be able to pay my rent or whatever. What if. Yeah well what if i can't. Keep. A semblance of stability of my life and it's actually. Hard work to be stables. And i know it's hard work to be stable but. What. Chances of a lot of what-ifs. And anything is things that haven't happened. And it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened and i know that. But it's still how it still fix it. That's actually. A source of. Anxiety. Anxiety go by getting things done. Figuring things out making a solid plan and going for it. But i know that's a cycle. And i'll go from. Being really anxious and oh my god what am i going to do what am i going to do. Nothing okay what is. The fundamental thing i need to take care of here. Me1 what is just. Extraneous. Look what can what. Is what are the actual not issues and what is the actual issue. Esso. Figure out how to figure things out that way and then things i decided to go with a little bit. But then something will pop up in the what if so come up again. I'll have to. Figure it out again. I know it's a cycle i know. What seems huge. On the surface. We start chipping away at it. You get over it pretty quickly get through it. The last time i felt really happy. I don't know. Huh. Kid question like that actually surprisingly stumped me. Because i do feel happy sometimes sometimes. Not so much as i just cannot. And the middle. Really like over joyously happy i don't know. If not i can't think of when. That happened. I don't know you don't know. Perceptions of other people. Mean. Probably a somebody who. Auto enough somebody who. Is laid-back and. Yo. Handle things as they come but i don't see myself as at. At all. As it is. Probably that. I can think on my feet. And. I'm not afraid to. Hustle my butt off and do whatever i have to do to survive and get things done. That. And i can do it creatively and i try to. Strive for balance. Play. Play the best things about me. Then i'm doing basically what i want with my life which. Even though it's not all easy it's not. Am not financially well-off or anything. It's a lot more than a lot of people can say about their life. Cuz i have an aunt that i really don't talk to. Who and the reason why i don't talk to her because she's always miserable. Missy scott. A career. That she. It's more of a job that she fell into. Cuz my older aunt. Loves animals but didn't want to be a veterinarian. So she became a dog groomer. It was actually really good at it she had. A stable business for a long time. But. Her know she tried to get arthritis in her hands. And. She had. That should my cousin's father went and cut a. Stole all the money for her business so she lost your business. She kind of retired early cuz it's between that next friday she want to retiring early. She employed my younger aunt who is still a dog groomer. But she hates it. As like. Change your life if you hate your life so much change it. And i think the thing i'm most proud of is. Yeah not as financially well-off as she is. But i'm doing what i want in my life you know i can. Be creative i can have creative people around like people who actually like to talk to around me. People actually like in my life and. Be happy with that. Thanks a lot of people who aren't. And it gives me a sense of. Video of bloated sense of south satisfaction to be able to i'm not like that. But i'm actually doing what i want even though. Their sacrifices i'm still fundamentally doing what i want with my life now. Thank you. Thank you. Goodbye. \n",
      "Okay. Alright you're welcome. Anytime you ready. Sure. Another day pretty well except for drive weather. Originally i'm from detroit michigan. Yes. Back in the 80s. It's been awhile the last time it's been about 5 years. Not even close. Morissette back out here is you do you have the weather that's that's that's if i'm not pump prominent reason for coming is the weather. Because maybe better opportunities. And the weather. Yes. It took a minute had to adjust to the. Different attitudes of the people. The surroundings. Allocations and the. Bass area that someone had to cover to get the one spot to another. The weather off of wonder never end never snows in in in southern california. 2. The prospects of starting a business or becoming. Self-employed. Doing what i like to do. The people. They're not friendly for no no one's friendly out here you know becky sandile from the and was raised in the south. Where everybody's are cordial friendly high when you passing the streets out here people think that you have some agenda just for saying hello i'm passing so that's what i don't like about alley. Used to used to be on the road a lot i was a truck driver and plus entertainment coach driver for a chevrolet. I'm motown bands back in the day so yeah so i'm used to traveling yes. This is a this is actually a beautiful country so just doing the countryside of visiting different town different cultures different towns and seeing how. Basically how the rest of the country our lives. Some not-so-good some bad and some good. Denver colorado. I live in tampa for couple years which is really a great city. And then i lived in atlanta which is a really great state where is you know you have the southern southern attitude southern attitude was everybody's friendly in and gets along and. And this eat i've been back and forth cross-country lease. 16 to 20 times so. It's it's been it's been an adventure. Arkansas. Little rock. Where i had to get into a. You might want to say alteration. With the rednecks down there because you know i'm african-american. And down there they're very pretty that you know they're that. Southern rebels. What weekday is confederates i still have this tendency of thinking blacks. Or any other cultures besides whites aren't the. Bible people. Yeah sorry i had an incident down there where it actually turned into a shootout. But i'm okay. Hello about that depends on it depends on the time. Unpair depends on what mood i'm in at the time you don't i can't be outgoing cuz i do like to go to nightclubs and listen to live music live bands and i know like i said i i just meant attend before so. At clubs are more outgoing and social events more shy. Meditate. Very good very good because. If i let my temper get the best of me i-10 to. Cosmo. Harm. Then good. I'm sure the person hunter myself by. You know. Physical altercations or going to jail. Yeah i'm very good at that. Controlling my emotions. My temper. Good question. Okay girlfriend. We just recently broke up about 23 weeks ago. Because of argument about what she thought she could do and what i know she couldn't do. And she wanted to do it anyway so. That led to argument and argument ended in us breaking up so. It was emotional. But. I'm 55 and it's not my first break up so i just take it in stride and and move on. Well. Aspire. No one no no situation actually can be. I feel at the time when you when you deal with a situation at any particular time it's probably always a better way to handle it. After the fact. Butt dial. I would say back in the day back in the 80s when me and my wife broke up. I think i could have handled that one better because i was younger more hot-tempered. And more irrational so i could have handled that one better yes. The way i broke with the way i handled that situation. Well like i said being young and inexperienced than and emotions and attitudes and. Not being able to communicate. With another person on level of. Understanding. Leaving home. Well it was like. Okay i say. It was about. 12 in the morning. And i just decided to pack up and and and leave without letting anyone know that i was leaving. That was like one of the hardest decisions that i have to make it. Sketchy. Loving bus schedule. My family is in detroit and atlanta georgia. I'm in california. I have no one out here so. I'm basically on my own and i've been on my own for a long time so. We communicate and we talk and send. Christmas cards thanksgiving cuz you know and that fact but as far as. Family is. Sketchy. No one. I don't know. Most things that that i don't want to remember i don't sew and i have erased a lot of things for my memory or. Play some in the closet which i can't open any more till to remember that so but the most thing that i can say is. I won't go into detail on it but i answered netware. Because great bodily harm to a person. In the last 2 weeks with the i've had on. This heartburn problem so in the last two weeks it's been really difficult. For me to get. I'm sleep that's i have i have in my pocket right now i have a jar of tums. It's keeping me pretty sedated right now. Irritable. Anxious. Need to get things done. And. I feel like i have a people. And things that's. Against me and trying to block everything that i'm doing to secede and that's. Been a great disturbance to me. Yes it is but you know what like i said i take everything it was a grain of salt and i keep pushing because. You can't stay mad. Or vengeful at anyone personally one thing too long because it doesn't accomplish anything so i have to keep pushing. I know baby i'm still the same i just. Just keep my i keep my ideas that i need to do. And try to accomplish that when i need to. Accomplish. Post-traumatic stress. No. Yes. Bacchanal. 09. 2009. Crying. A lot. Not trusting. Suspiciousness of other people. So what and i was recommended. I'm refer to a medical. Mental health facility. The treatment. Off-and-on yes when i feel depressed and feel anxiety building up in me yes i still have to. Yes because i get a chance to express some of the things that. I normally don't express. And i can i come like. Joel osteen. Block anxiety part of a manufacturing. I don't know really really happy. When i was really really happy when my girls i just broke up with came from upstate. For us to be together. That's when i was really really happy. And then i turned around within two weeks but at that point in time when that happened i was really really happy. Witty. Witty. Informative. Social. Bass exe i need to actually became a counselor because i'm very. And waiting in a lot of lights. Problems. So. My friends would describe me as helpful. Probably. Education education. Not raising my sons. Well my son my my sons were young at age when me and my wife broke up. Out here and she moved and remarried and. She had she had two boys with her and. They took on the new husband's name and i wasn't able to raise them like i would have wanted amazed. Patients more patience. Gmmore. Acceptable of other ideas in other people's opinions.

I know it's hard it's hard to talk about marketing it requires. Minaj of. You know how it's how it how it's done and it takes several months to 21. Well i guess i originally kind of shy but. But i become more outgoing just cuz of work and stuff. I like to exercise. I do hiking with my dogs we walk up and down a hill a couple times set. Good. I don't remember. I don't know nothing comes to mind. I don't i don't clean my car at michaelis of dog hair in it and i feel bad when i should always stay on top of that just getting to the carwash and stuff. Well i had a conflict with my brother and so i had to decide to happen estrangement from him and that makes the most. Santa that was a somewhat difficult. Decision but just because of his angry behavior wasn't it wasn't that difficult but. You know what it was somewhat difficult because i i loved him very much so. I'm not close to my family so. But i don't really have one. I have. A japanese friends i think the sensor came up i have a japanese friend i'm very close but she's like my my mother. And. I just met him socially.

Well i'm recovering from ptsd. So i sometimes feel that the ptsd and then i'll take a medication for that. No it's just stop. It's just leftover if that i'm still have the stress from it i'm still being treated for it. Did they don't really have any. Talk about it. I'm in the past but it's treated. 5 years ago. I was i was just very sad very depressed and so today so i went to. The doctor and they helped me. That i did a psychotherapy. The app for the ptsd though. I guess so. It's just i'm. Just kind of supportive because of. The issues i have with my family it's a supportive to have a doctor who is supportive and. You know it just gives me good feedback and helps me to make a decision that sort of thing. I have nightmares about my family sometime. Nah. I just try to sleep better i had i hide it before i go to sleep i sort of. Like i. Meditate a little bit to get to be calm and then hope that that will help. I've been happy all the time pretty much like i am a dog's make me happy and. Yeah my life is really happy. I guess you know as a nice person thoughtful. A good friend. And happy fun person. I don't remember my forties now so i'm pretty happy with myself i don't mind. You know. I've done a lot of work on myself and in therapy in south so i'm pretty. I wouldn't really change a lot i'm pretty happy with myself and i'm not to sound conceited but i'm i'm pretty. Happy with myself now. That would that would be my parents are very abusive so. I said i don't talk to them anymore so you know any times with them you know that stay. Yes it did terrible things to raise. I prefer not to talk about it. Galaxy. Well i just started reading a book i like to read cookbooks and i was just reading a book called on when french women cook and it's about. The woman's relationship with different women in france in different parts of france and the and the cooking and some really enjoying the book. I usually you know i'm get the grocery shopping done which i enjoy i really i really like doing the grocery shopping i go to a few places. Angela bit of cleaning and. Just i relax. Yeah i would i would say. To have better self-esteem cuz i just have very low self-esteem you know from being abused and so. And i i wish i'd been happier in the past and you know taking me a long time to become unhappy because. Dinner no matter what it what i did whatever achievements i i was i was never happy in the past i was i was always struggling with. Being depressed i didn't even know why and now and i realized. Passive whatever then said it that it was from my parents from that relationship into. But the advice would be to not have a relationship that is bad for you like sometimes estrangement is the best. Twice and abusive relationship. The way i live my life the way i treat people i think you know. I believe it that your deeds are very important that i try to treat people in a good way and. And i guess you know i'm proud of my work like decisions i made that. That'll give me. I know a guy. A job that i liked me a lot of. Flexibility and i got to do what i like and. And you know people like my work and. And also make my dogs. I'm really proud of them and. Baguette. Okay. Thank you. That was funny. Yeah. And then just do this. \n",
      "So if i say take off your top will she do it. Okay she's kind of hot that's my kind of woman. Alrighty then thank you. Yes. I feel great. I am from. Los angeles california. The weather. The opportunity. And the ocean. It's overcrowded. Overpriced. And somewhat dirty. I have. Well it's nice to see other places in the world. And to meet other people and cultures. I work. On cruise ships as a musical entertainer. And travel to alaska aleutian islands. Korea. Japan. And the caribbean islands. Being in galena alaska and being on a small airplane. And traveling in a snowstorm. And surviving. Like i was on the edge of death and life but i lived. The arts. And business. I don't know i was attracted to the arts at a young age. And business went along with it. Yes. Yes. To be able to entertain people and make them feel emotions and make enough money to have a comfortable life. More outgoing. I always feel very confident with my thoughts. And i like people to know what i have to say. I listen to music. And i sit with my girlfriend. And she calms me down when i'm stressed out. I could work on that i'm not very good at that. Last night. With my girlfriend. She was asking my advice on something and. As i was speaking to her she felt my tone of voice was too loud. I was not angry. But i was irritated that i was being told to quiet down when i didn't really want to help i just wanted to relax. I agree. Sometimes when things don't go my way i get depressed or upset. And i wish i could come down and just realize that i should count my blessings. And look at the bright side of everything no matter how bad things get. Always look at the bright side that's my goal. It's been very difficult but i'm working on it and it seems to be getting a little easier. Well i when i was taking care of my mother and she was dying of copd and then it turned into lung cancer. I chose not to tell her that her condition had worsened. So she wouldn't be fearful and i had to sit knowing that her symptoms were getting worse. But i couldn't tell her the truth. And i let her think that everything was okay. It was. My mother being sick and dependent on oxygen for 3 years and me seeing her health declined. That's what plagues me the most in my dreams and in my thoughts. If i can erase that if that never happened i would feel better. Oh i don't know i try to. Be grateful i'm alive and try to focus. On my own objectives. And not dwell on the negative things of my memory. My girlfriend she's a very good vibe positive influence she wants me to be a better person. Cheese since i met her she's been trying to make me not be angry. To make me not feel negative and to be a nurturing positives in like manso. What she's asking for is something that's going to make me improve therefore i must capitulate. It's very easy. I sleep well. Sometimes i wake up when i have nightmares about my mother or something but i go back to sleep. That's unknown i don't know. It just happens. I've been feeling. Good. Add to my reality is. I've been hit with a lot of financial. Problems but i'm handling them well actually. I've been looking at it as my girlfriend is told me that. I need to do this so therefore it is on the forefront of my mind right now. No. No. Today. When i woke up and it was a sunny beautiful day and i had a lot of goals to achieve and i'm achieving each 11 by 12 gives me a sense of accomplishment and happiness. My ideal weekend would be playing music with my girlfriend is that something we enjoy to do. Hat going out to a nice dinner of healthy food. And maybe exercising. And feeling good with my body and mind and spirit. Probably. As a strong-willed person with a big heart. But it has a short fuse in. Maybe he complains about his own life too much. I wish i could not complain about negative things that happen and learn to roll with the punches. And always look at the bright side. Well one time i had a good friend tell me that one of the recordings i did he thought was horrible and i felt it was the best thing i've ever done. So that. And i really don't understand how anybody could could feel that way. And i didn't know if it was from jealousy or it was an honest evaluation. So therefore i felt bad about that. As it's my goal. No nothing i regret. Channel 20 years ago. I don't know. Well everything i do enjoy it's hard to pick out one exact event that i really enjoyed. I don't know. How to put one above the other. When things don't go my way in. Finances. Come down and i don't get jobs at i go for that i am qualified for but i feel like i'm not getting. My fairchance. At opportunity. It's very frustrating. I don't really feel guilty about things. Sometimes maybe if i'm angry and i shouldn't be that i feel guilty about that i don't ever want to be. Short with my girlfriend ever. She'll win that doesn't deserve somebody using vulgar language or shouting. Or something so i don't want to be that way around her so therefore that i am guilty. My achievements of my abilities through my music and my other abilities that i have in my hard work has paid off and. I'm very proud of those. Okay thank you. Goodbye. I like her can i have four in my house to talk to me everyday. \n",

Weather thought it was like you know ridiculous to me because you go to a play cindy have the money ask for something you can ask for something because you have it and not just to wait till the time just because they saw a logo of a card that's how that you know it was ridiculous for me. No. What advice would you give yourself. Basically to stay more focused on different things that stay in school. And then i don't go thinner try to control my temper and do different things because if i knew what i know now back then he'll be different.

      "Okay sounds good. Thanks. Yeah thanks. I'm well thank you how are you. I grew up in oklahoma. I moved la about five-and-a-half years ago so i used to be on the wet on the east coast and then i decided i wanted to come out here. My hometown not very often most of my families moved away so i visit them but i don't actually get back to oklahoma march. Oklahoma's very different. Ali's lot more exciting there is a lot more. To do here and. I the ocean obviously is very nice. You know that's a good question i am. I wanted to try something new and i've always loved the beach and. I thought i also like big cities so i thought la might be a good place for me to come. Very it's probably one of the best decisions i ever made. Easy i think it seems kind of natural that seems like a good fit. I'm actually like it here. That's great i have a couple of roommates and we get along really well i have a couple of blocks from the beach. And everyday i get to walk on the beach or. Hang out with friends and it's just it's kind of like being on vacation all the time it's really nice. I studied philosophy and political theory and government. And did a little bit of english literature on the side. Kind of just happen naturally i think i went to liberal arts school and got kind of exposure to a lot of different areas and. I just followed what i liked and was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that. Not exactly i work for an educational nonprofit so i work with greta with graduate students in the social sciences and humanities. But i don't actually. Use my philosophy background very often. You know i haven't actually study to become a success coach. And so i working with students has is kind of a nice. Respective of doing that but i'd really like to work with with other people's i'm not just students. But help them to achieve their goals and realize their dreams. I take it it's fairly hard in the sense that. You know it can be challenging for people to actually. Be motivated and do all the work that needs to be. Undertaken in order to realize their their dreams but it's also a challenge because making a living at it requires charging people money so i'm finding people who are willing to pay for that can be difficult to. I'm definitely on the fireside i'm an introvert so. I'm pretty good in one-on-one situations with people but when you get me in a group with more than a couple of people i very much an observer so i tend to listen a lot and i'm not as engaged. And i think that is. Something that goes it is noticed by others and it maybe is a little bit odd to them especially if they're not introverted. So i bet say and it's also tend not to be the person who introduces myself. In a roomful of strangers. Pretty good i think. But i do have a temper. So. I can't get i can't get upside from time to time. Really it can be a challenge when i'm driving but other than that no. I'm not sure. It would have probably been a discussion over politics. And it probably would have been a friendly argument. Probably with one of my liberal friends. But i actually can't remember the specific time. I meditate. I. Do that almost everyday. I also walk at the beach i love the ocean and i. Really like the sounds and just being out there is very peaceful. And i like to read. Be. Alone just. With my thoughts. That's nice. Well let me think about that for a minute. Having a hard time coming up with anything i mean i'm sure there are plenty of things. Nothing comes to mind. Okay i'm sorry. Well this isn't exactly an event it's what's a dream and it's not a particularly. Traumatic dreams as far as dreams go but i do have it sometimes. Probably more often than i'd like so i wouldn't be upset if it. And if i didn't have it. And it's just a version of a dream that i think a lot of people probably have but. It's usually me and school somewhere. At the end of the semester. Haven't gone to class taking the exams know i'm going to fail. And. In a really unhappy about it wishing why didn't i. Studying attend class the way i should have. Which actually wasn't really a problem for me in school but now i have the stream sometimes and it's kind of frustrating. And i'm not exactly sure. Why i mean i know why but i don't know what it applies to because it's not like i. I'm worried consciously at least about failing things so. No i don't think so. At least not that i'm aware of. I feel guilty i have a brother and a sister-in-law and a nephew and they live on the east coast. And i love my nephew he's ate he's adorable and. I when i used to live there when he was younger spent a lot of time with them and. Since i've been in california and particularly in the last year i spent a lot last time visiting them so. For example i saw them for week of christmas and then i went back. I think beginning of may so it was. You know for months between the the last time i'd seen them. And that i felt bad about because. We really enjoy each other's company and he. You know really likes me to be there but then he gets upset when i leave and he asks when am i coming back. So that's um. That makes me feel bad sometimes. Well i have a brother i'm very close to him. He's younger. And. 44 and a half years younger he's married i have a nephew. My both my parents have passed away. So it's just the two of us and. We have a large extended family but we're not that close with them. With most of them. On my father's side there's one brother. And he's married and has if you could drive to cousins on that side then on my mother's side there are. 545 other kids. Most of them with several children of their own so i have a lot of cousins on that side but they live all over the country and. So we stay in touch a little bit through facebook and they're a couple that i talk to you on the phone and visit every now and then. But you know we're not that close with our extended family so. Say it well. I am in a lot of friends i think that have been positive influences. When i came out to california. I started working at a nonprofit and it was kind of a strange place. Is very different from what i was used to. There was a little bit challenging and she also work there so we worked on a program together over the summer and got to know one another and. We've discussed out with this really strong friendship and. She's kind of i would say my best friend probably here and probably just in general and now she's moved to vegas. Which is a little bit tough for me. But we're going to napa this weekend so that should be good but she's been a very she was very positive influence because when i came out here to really know anybody. Andina since i'm an introvert it's not that easy for me to make friends was really nice because we share a lot of same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know. I think she kind of gets me so it's a lot of fun to hang out with her and and that's been nice. I'm sleeper so it's pretty easy. Sometimes my you know. Depending on. How long i've been awake i can be what a little wound up and somehow got to take a little while to decompress but i usually meditate right before i go to bed and that's very helpful. And i can sleep. I generally sleep in 90 minutes cycles. So usually six or seven and a half hours but i can easily sleep 9 hours if i have the time and inclination. I usually don't wake up in the middle of the night. Or at least if i do i don't remember it. Well i actually don't sleep very well when i travels one of the things i do for work is i travel quite a bit. Because i work for a company that's back east so i work from home. Most of the time but then i travel. Like one week a month. And when i travel i'll take the red-eye. And then i'll visit with a lot of friends in the evening so i don't sleep that much it's not that i. Sleep. Poorly or badly it's just that i don't have that much time to sleep. And the first day. After not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay. Usually the second day it's not very good. I'm so i get a lot more tired and it's harder to concentrate. And. I don't know it just feels like more of a struggle. Good. Summerisle is an is a busy time for the organization that i work for so i'm a little. I don't know stresses right word but i'm you know a little anxious about. Everything going well this summer but in general i'm feeling pretty good. Really i can't i can't do anything. There is one thing i am i do struggle with exercise like i like to walk a lot. And i hike with friends and. I've been really motivated about it for a couple of months but then i went away these custom when i came back i was a lot less motivated. Cuz i didn't really exercise when i was there. And i got out of the habit even though i didn't only been about 10 days and so now i'm struggling to try and get back in the routine and it's not going as well as i would like. That's okay. Thank you. Now. Now. Well. He's a lot of fun and. He really likes me and i really like him and we play a lot of games and talk a lot and actually doing a book club now so we're going to skype and. Maybe some more time with him that way but just being around him is fun. Well she probably say that i know how to have fun. But that i can be serious. And. That i care about others. And that i'm loyal. And. I'm not sure what else. I think those those are probably the main things. I wish i had more self-discipline so. I wish that you know i could dye it or eat healthier foods and not have a problem. With sugar because i love tea sugar. I wish that i would not procrastinate because i've gotten a lot better about that but i still do and i can be challenging. And i wish that i. I don't know. I. I wish that i was in a relationship. So. Probably those things. So the last organization i used to work. At. I had a boss and she was. I don't feel like she was. I don't think we were very compatible and she. Is push my button. Or so i thought. And so. One day she was really upset about something because of board member i called her up and ask her a question and she didn't have the answer. And he was upset about something and. It was something to do with my department. So she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was. But it wasn't i i've been a manager for many years and i. Have very strong opinions about how you handle challenges with. With staff members. And way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate i thought. Almond she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel. Incompetent least that's the way that i felt about it. And. I didn't you know. I tried to be very calm and. Said that i would take care of it and i did take care of it but. After that our relationship wasn't really the same and i ended up leaving there. To go back to the old organization that i work for not that long afterwards because i just didn't really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me. Or after we had that interaction. So i heard this piece of advice the other day and or this thing that i thought was really profound and i wish that i had. Read it back then. Which is. When you think about buying something instead of thinking. Oh. Here's this beautiful coat it's $100 i want it i'm going to buy it. Don't think of it as costing $100 think of a disgusting 10 times that because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it. You know. Intelligently you would have ten times that much money eventually so. You should really think about it in those terms and i think i've been much more consumer than a saber and so i wish that i had to. Been more aware of that 10 or 20 years ago. Probably. They asked me to be his godparents and his guardian if anything should happen to them. And that meant a lot to me because of it made me feel like. They trusted me and thought that i was a good person that kind of person that could take care of their child should something happen to them. Let's see. Well it wasn't really recently been in february i went i like to travel and a friend and i went to singapore and i got to fly first class. Smiles frequent flyer miles to get the. Tickets and so that was really enjoyable because. The seats fold down to sleep the food is delicious you get special attention and i also hadn't been to singapore before so that was kind of cool to. Sure. Thank you. Bye. Hey. \n",
      "Alright. Thank you. Yes. If you want okay little bit tired but for the most part feeling pretty good. I'm actually originally from woodland hills which is out in the san fernando valley was born there. And that i move to lomita which is in los angeles county. About. Probably around 1993 so i mean i'm 23 now so. About what is 19 years or so. I've been living there now. Some things that i really like i would have to say you know. The beach. You know. Not so much the traffic don't really care for that but. Definitely you know just kind of like the nightlife you know. Just people in general high like conversing with others so. Yeah actually i do i mean i can't see your shoes but yeah actually i do travel a lot. I've been to places like hawaii. Been to the caribbean. I've been to see. No just different places like. Arizona i've been to oregon washington. Pretty much all over i would say so but usually mainly like hawaii the caribbean mexico as well so. Yep. I think it's just the experience you know it like you can't you can kind of experience the culture. Different people you know. Just just the whole background the scenery is just you know it's. It's something new to experience that would say. Something that you know people haven't seen before so. Willits ci recently took a trip to hawaii a couple months ago that was back in december was around christmas time new year's so that was pretty fun we went to a couple different islands. We went to fletc at think it was kawaii went to awahoo. Maui you know places like that so. Yep. You know i would have to say that. You know probably like in hawaii her like the caribbean you know just like i said before the whole experience factor. Just seeing you know new different things things that are unique so. Actually study journalism right now i'm in my final semester. Somebody graduate. Couple months. Well you know it's kind of funny cuz you know i started off at a two-year community college. And so yeah i was going into my business management something to do with you know i think basically accounting. But you know i kind of figured that wasn't for me. So i decided to go into journalism because i couldn't i mean you know i'd probably still be sitting at a desk but. You know lisa journalism i could go on the field me to talk to people and you know. You know receive information gathering information that sort of deal and then you don't write up stories. I just thought it was you i was a lot more interesting for me as opposed to you know just kind of crunching numbers all day so. My dream job i would have to say you know something something and maybe radio broadcasting. Sports broadcasting. You know i think. Daddy really interesting something that's definitely a passion of mine. My relationship my family it's it's pretty good you know i'd lose my parents still. Like i said i'm 23 years old. You know there's certain times when i can be a little bit shaky little bit rocky but for the most part it's it's pretty good amateur it a lot in the last few years so. Things are. Getting back up to speed i would say. Things are things are going pretty well. You know i think it's them somewhere. Kind of in the middle. You know sometimes i can be very outgoing and talkative the people when i'm relaxed and laid-back. Other times i kind of it's not so much like i go into my shell butt. You know times like i can be kind of shy if i don't know people as well or if i haven't never met them before. So it's one of those things that kanye kind of got to meet me in the middle with it because you know. I can neither be talked very talkative. Ora x you know i can be a little bit shy but you know once i once i get the conversation going. Barely talk to you again. Immuno usually. I would listen to music. Orino maybe just you know kind of go for a drive. You know hang out with my friends you know just something that just the kind of you know. He's he's that cuz he not like i said sometimes you get a little bit you know tense and you just want to relax and you know just do the things that you enjoy. You know i've actually been better with that. Couple years back unite. Points were like i pretty much couldn't control my temper. Like whatsoever and i i mean i would just. Pretty much get angry. Yeah the littlest things everything we just kind of ticked me off but. You know i've definitely learned to you know. Control that sort of thing. And you don't make me a better person because of it. Well let's see i'm trying to think it was probably something with my family with my mother maybe. I can't remember off the top of my head but. You know it's it's always something so miniscule that. That's why i probably don't remember it. But you know eventually we makeup and i apologize for it because you know. I accept that. Yeah i'm wrong and you know certain circumstances. Something that i feel guilty about. Probably you know not being as nice to others as i could have been in the past you know i mean that is the past and you know i don't like this wellness order thing. But i think that's one thing that i got tried to work on but it's also one thing that i kind of regret. Not doing just being just being nice. Precision ever had to make pretty recent. Kind of tough because i actually have a buddy. He was in the air force and he recently got. Diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia i said i was really tough. And it's hard for me to talk to him because you know he's not really all there anymore like we used to be. So it's one of those things were feel like i'm kind of ignoring him and i don't want to do that but at the same time i don't know is tennessee's. You could be a little. Crazy. Sorry. Probably like me on some sort of like traumatic stress disorder maybe when he was in the military so i don't know. But yeah. Yeah it's pretty tough because we go way back. Been best friends with a. Cintas by that 56 years old. So it's just yeah just really hard to deal with but you know i try to. I don't i don't you know. Try to keep in the back of my mind but you know it's always there i don't ever forget so. My best friend. He probably say that you know i'm a pretty. Pretty down-to-earth guy. Usually pretty honest. Sometimes brutally honest but i try to work on that too. You probably say that i'm pretty funny. I like to hang out you know just. Canada. Do things here and there you know i'm just. Normal activities like any other person you know go to the beach hang out watch a movies grab a few beers that started deal so. You know it varies sometimes it's easier than others you know if i'm really tired and you know i'll probably have a very good sleep. I've been sleeping all that great the last few days cuz she know. My house there's workers on the roof so they're you're putting in the new roofings that's kind of tough. That always wakes me up early in the morning so. Sometimes a little bit crabby butt. For the most part. Usually get pretty good sleep. Lily. I feel pretty good. You know because you know things are starting to look up. I actually got an internship about a month ago. You know my field of journalism so that's good. About to graduate in two months so i'm looking forward to that. I'm starting to make a little bit more money that's you know that's good. And yeah things are just going pretty well right now i can't complain. It's it's not bad you know like i said it could always be worse right but. You know i'm enjoying life so. That's the best part. I've not. Nope. Last time i felt really happy man. You know it was probably going back to my buddy when you know he was still. Still have a sanity i guess you could say. You know you came back to visit from the air force yet some leave. So you know you're just hanging out. No just kicking back having a few beers and. Just talking about life so that was nice but i miss that you know so. I feel great do you know. Because there's nothing like having a best friend and you can have conversation you know 24/7 about anyting. It's all anything timmy confidence. You can tell me anything in confidence like. It's hard to find especially someone that. You've known for so many years and then you can't really get it back now so. Yeah there there's a. It's probably one or two things that i regret. Well i mean i got a dui.. 34 years ago actually was four years ago that's something that i definitely regret because you know i look back on it and you know things might have been different but at the same time. You have to accept you know the actions. Circumstances. I took place. So you know i'm and up. And not i guess i think i better off for it. But at the same time you know it's always going to be in the back of my mind like i said. It's just one of those things you have to deal with in your own way. Well you know it's one of those things like. I was a child then so i really don't know what to say mean even if. I would have listened then who knows. But you know i probably would have told myself you know just. Be careful you know. Make sure you can be the best person you possibly can candy. Basically you know just always be nice be honest. Just be caring for others so. Probably going back to. My buddy with the jolla. Paranoid schizophrenic thing. I don't say that i wish i could erase it i just wish that it didn't happen like that so. My ideal weekend i usually keep it pretty pretty generic i. Then hang out my friends. Either you know we hang out in the day. And i do certain things like you know maybe grab a few beers. You know just have casual conversation maybe play games watch movies just the standard stuff that people do so. Some things that i wish i could change. Probably just you know be nicer like i said before. Baby not being as lazy. Have more determination. I mean i have quite a bit of determination i know what i want to do with my life. But i know there were times when i kind of. Get a little lackadaisical and so i wish i could improve upon that and not procrastinate as much. So. Well you know it's tough to think back. But i would probably say a time when someone made me feel really bad as you know. I would say probably like when i was kind of getting angry at certain people maybe just kind of chewing out my friends when i probably shouldn't have. I'll try to get more constructive criticism but. At the same time i knew it was probably not my place to say those kinds of things and. They were out of character so. My best qualities i would say that i'm definitely hard-working. I'm determined. Very caring now. More than i used to be. Very honest. And you know i just i love to talk to people. I like i like making. New relationships. I like making people laugh. Something that i did recently that i really enjoyed. You know it's probably over at my internship i was just you know i wrote a story or two. And it just felt good you know to get those stories done and eventually they're going to go into the paper so. I feel accomplished about that. You know it's one of those things when you work at something and then you see the product. Right there. You know it's right in your face and. You can tell yourself you don't like i did that. So. Makes you feel good. You know just let's see few different stories that just usually thinks about will the papers in long beach so it's usually about you know stories are events that are taking place in long beach so. I would say that i'm most proud of you no graduating. High school. graduate college. Hopefully you know i was jamming to earn a degree and then hopefully get a. You know a good solid job. You know in the near future. I think that's one thing that i'm most proud of. Thank you. \n",

Automatically engage with people as opposed to being hesitant first. Oh. Middle school and i was always the. Low man on the totem pole socially. Being a constant butt of jokes. Don't fall in the trap of thinking that middle high school is life. Sometime you know if was children and family doing some fun activity beecher museum or something.

Okay. \n",
      "So when she. Okay alright thanks. Hi. Are you okay. Yeah go ahead. Okay. Where are you. I grew up in wisconsin and i lived in colorado for a bit and then i lived overseas for a little while and then i moved to california. I moved here at the end of june of last year so i guess it's been 8 months something like that. At the most probably twice a year. Will my hometown is olive 5,000 people and there are a lot of cows. And barns. And farms so the opposite of la. I got question i. Always wanted to live in california. Sale but i had two living in in the central coast. And. I just have been coming down to la like once a month for different business and that working and personal development stuff so. Yeah things were changing. In santa cruz for me that client i had who is really the main like financial. Main financial source i had that relationship ended so i was totally free to move and i thought well i guess i'll give ali a try and see what happens so. To give a shot and here i am. No not at all. Very very big. City. I lived in dublin in ireland was also a big city but. In a european cities are much more condensed in the public transportation is much more easy. And. Yeah so just getting around here and getting familiar with the city was pretty challenging and. You travel a lot i love to travel i love it. I'm i lived in ireland and i traveled. I've been morocco and i was in costa rica. Spend some time in mexico. Yeah. I love. Meeting new people experiencing new cultures and. Like. Also. Not just seeing what's different but seeing what's similar among people everywhere you go. Sure well. I guess. Trying to think which is my favorite song midnight there's amazing things about morocco and costa rica both but. Morocco's incredible is like 12 days and. We went to three different locations moving up in the atlas mountains are beautiful and. Yeah it's a really really cool culture. My trip to ireland i actually visited there. Which is why i decided to move there so. My most memorable moment of that trip i mean there's probably dozens but. The first most memorable moment about triplets. Being a bison and leaving dublin and going to sound to the countryside inn. Sing how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful it is ms. Everyone is these pictures of ireland renac in films and it's green and lush and gorgeous but. You actually get there and experience it is. Like the pictures don't do it justice so incredible. I might have an undergrad degree in english in psychology. And a psychology minor and i have a master's degree in women's studies. No i use my english in psychology i work in marketing communications so. Actually do sales. So i'm. Yeah the psychology definitely comes into. Comes into play and. So does my. I guess my undergrad. Degree in english but really like i took that on and and created something out of it because most people get an english degree just teach and i i wasn't wanting to teach. 2. Cuz i'm not clear on the question. Okay. I love my job. You could almost say. Wow. You know what my dream job is. Being a. A motivational speaker and trainer and coach. And traveling the world doing that and impacting people's lives and. Really contributing to people. Tell me about your relationship. Relationships pretty good actually i. I just repaired my relationship with my biological mother who would. Knots. She was sporadic i saw her sporadically growing out they lived my dad raised me. And then he married my stepmom and. And they had two kids together so i grew up and i consider them like the family i grew up with. So but i got communication with my biological mother. Last may and we've been. Clear things up. And have been. And communication since then. Well not sure which moment you mean but if you're referring to be in communication with my birth mother. And it's very freeing. To just let go of the past and let the past be the past and. Great something new with the future. And not just the future but in the present moment with her so. Yeah. I'm shy. Screensaver. I know it's not polite. It's relax i do a number of things i like to do yoga and i don't have the money for it right now i love to dance. I love to read. I love to go to the ocean and spend time just staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions. That really recharge is my battery actually probably more than anything else. I'd like to be with friends. I love. Arts and trying new restaurants. Yeah all those things are. Both relaxing i guess they're relaxing in the sense that. I feel connected. The people my life into the experiences of my life so. Yeah. How are you. Depends if i'm driving not very good. Otherwise i'm pretty good at it. Argue with somebody. Probably would have to be. Ono is what the la times about the newspaper delivery. Yeah that was the last time. Tell me about the. Yeah. The newspaper that was supposed to show up for the. Elderly lady that i take care of. It didn't show up. And. I didn't realize that it wasn't there until. I'm late i don't know afternoon i think early afternoon and then i called them and. They said they couldn't send the replacement because it was after 10:30 in the morning which is absurd to me when they made a mistake in the first place. So i made for service that would pay for it for everyday. Yeah it was really irritated and then i found out that. The newspaper had been. Forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me so. Singer the only times there's anger the people who'd forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me pretty frustrated. Noel are quite a few of those. I think about 1. The other day i had a phone call. And i'm going to coaching program and. It was from one of the coaches in the program. And she was. I'm explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be we have meetings every week. Classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls cuz we have one particular coach we work with. And then she called to tell me that i was going to have another coaching call. With. Someone who's not my couch. And. That. Hadn't been. Explain to me it's part of the program so it's in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my god i have all these people i have to be accountable to and like i have to. Not just be accountable to them but share private things are happening in my life with these people and it just was. So. Yeah i wasn't. I wasn't angry i was just i just felt frustrated in the little overwhelmed in that moment and. You do not talk it out with her without through it but. Yeah i could have. Certainly just been okay with what was being asked of me in the at that time and. But i made the call go a lot smoother. Large decision while there's been a few. I was moving to ireland was probably the hardest decision. No it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually. But telling my family about it was challenging. That by the hardest decision was my. The first time that i. Moved. Away from my family i was 28 and i decided to i chose to move to colorado. And i'm. That's a pretty tough decision at that point my family have been. You know within an hour's drive of where i lived an hour hour-and-a-half. And now they're going to be me now. A 12-hour drive away or plane right away so that was. Challenging. Oh lots of things. I love colorado colorado is beautiful beautiful state and. The weather is so much better than wisconsin and. At the time i was very much into rock climbing. And. There's just a huge outdoor outdoor community in colorado so they were a lot more people who were in my age group and or single that was another factor. And we're interested in the things i was interested in. So colorado to seem like a really natural fit so. Yeah and then i found a job that i liked. Pay was atrocious but. I found some work that was really rewarding and. Settle. Came together and i chose to move. Yeah. I was totally unrelated question. Relatively easily. And just. Pens on like what time i go to sleep. If i'm out. And don't get home until 11:30 then having to go to bed late. And i wake up feeling tired like i feel today. But generally i can sleep through the night i've had some pretty. Anxiety ridden dreams the last couple of weeks. But even sad when i wake up from those are five new stir from those i still can fall back to sleep. Relatively easily. I'm sure they are i may have another transition statham. Moving out of. Out of the house that i live in right now or take care of an elderly woman. Yeah and i just i have to find. The financial means to support me in doing that and it's. She creates a lot of anxiety. Justin. her state of being anxious exhausting and. Utterly depressing. Now. Live a pretty hard. Probably the hardest thing i've ever done and i would never ever choose to do it again if i honestly if i knew what i was getting into i don't think i would have said yes to the situation. I feel trapped and helpless. My best phenom nothing i can. No way out of the situation that i'm in no matter what i do it doesn't get any better i did i don't. I know i'm not getting any kind of work that i want to do. And. My money's not working at all. Yeah i feel pretty crappy. Thanks. I haven't passed yet. How long time i was 15 i think. 14 so is every 20 years ago. Are suicidal. Oh yeah i feel down. I don't actually now. Well i originally stomped. With my therapist because we had completed i mean we had. Worked on what needed to be worked on and i. It was no longer depressed. And i'm in the night. Begin therapy again. Later on. Think i would it was in my early 30s. I'm in the night we. Into that because i moved ireland. Yeah i'm in depending on the therapist and sitting on your intention like i i don't go into therapy thinking i'm going to be in this therapeutic relationship for the next 10 years i think that's ridiculous. I think you going to therapy to work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board you can see things that you can't see. And. We not work through that situation then come up with. A strategy for. Manoj is that not just in creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies. And tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to be in therapy forever. Tell me about the last time you felt. Can i feel really happy. Ultrasound. Zoe sierra go. No that's not true it was. When i. Saw my biological mother which was last may. My best qualities. I'm very strong. Very strong-willed. I. Very supportive and loving and nurturing. I'm easy to be around i'm intelligent and. Yeah. Anantara cry. I don't think so. Now. Don't take life too seriously. Ideal weekend. Imma spend some time with the beach and spend some time with friends. I'm either going out at night and have to a movie or. Just going out to. A club or bar somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together. Maybe go dancing after and sundays are usually go to. I don't have brunch with friends and. Yeah i go home and. Sunday night and get ready for the next day. I am most proud of. A few things. I mean. I've moved to places that i wanted to move to. So done things that have really spoken to me and if. Meant something. Been dear to my heart to actually. Achieve those those. Goals are those. Yeah i've done things that i wanted to do like move to ireland and move to california. Okay. I'm so. \n",

Human services courses. Mainly because i'm a people person. And i enjoy helping people. Wow i dream job. My dream job. I don't really have one right now. No i don't and i can't even see your shoes.

I got busy one night and i fell on my ankle and on my leg and so i'm just waiting for that to really heal but i'm planning on getting back into town and enjoy doing it really relaxes me. I really don't have a temper over the years i've learned how to do how to control that. Probably would have been yesterday but there was no argument. And what was it about. Nothing that i can recall. Something i feel guilty about. There's nothing right now that i feel guilty about. A situation that i wish i had handled differently. I really can't think of one right now. The hardest decision. Be absolutely hardest decision that i ever had to make. Who was with maya i have twins twin twin boys get grown now. I had twins. Twin teen teenagers. And i had lost my job and we were living in a motel. And. The rent for the motel was outrageous i couldn't no longer continue to pay the. Pay zakat the type of money that they wanted. So i had to briefly. Put my son under the in in foster care for 4. 4 minutes. That was the hardest decision i had to make. Schizophrenic. And he had had. He was born with auditory processing deficit which he overcame through training for a speech therapist in and school officials and he also this is. He also lost his hair when he was 4 years old. But. And then we part 14 the schizophrenia came up. So right now he he's going to supportive living environment is 27 years old. But he's he's come to terms with his mental illness and he accepts it now. We had problems in the past because he didn't want to take the medication to give him the medication and he hide it and stick it in his pocket or whatever so. But he's come to terms with that and we won't have come to terms with that he's doing he's doing pretty good. That sons 1:33 fancy a cuz he's a twin. I was living in texas with his wife. And. You got a promotion to. So now he's in california to beaufort and california okay so. That's a very good about that yeah. Well i've grown children yes. The grown children he has. No no. No i take that back. Not it's not hard to be a parent of grown on my grown children okay when they were younger it was difficult times okay difficult.. And. Is this. Solano good times too but yeah there's some difficult times. Well the difficult times i really pretty much already alluded to now is when. One of my twins got the diagnosis of schizophrenic and. And. They were in. Temporarily and. When was in foster care and one was actually in an institution because of the. Beyond schizophrenia. So. I lost track of the question. The hardest thing about being a parent. If it's point at this point in my life where is it's nothing hard about it. The best thing about being a parent. I don't know i guess it's just to see. Something that you created developed into a pretty decent human being. Hello a decent person. Smsa. Oh a lot of ways. Well actually. I didn't have two parents i had a mother and the father was never in my father was never in the home and he lived in another state so i have no contact with him. But the thing that i do. Differently than. What my mother did. She's a strong disciplinarian. Both verbally and physically. Free. She had the tendency to see how group. Play habits tennessee to be very critical okay clinical and. Okay united. And very religious. And swearing. For a lipid people who were not. That was me. I-15. We're living life wrong because it we're not going to church and reading the bible and all that kind of thing. The park. The question. I don't get a good night sleep i don't sleep at all unless i take medication and that's that that's all there is to it i don't take medication i don't sleep i'll be up all night. I will be up for dave. If i don't take medication. Irritable. I'm tired. Well. Lately. You know just a little anxious really. I just recently. Made a move to a new apartment is a lot of expenses and. New expenses and things like that in our new furniture a little different that that you have to get. What time i'm asked to do all that but. But the whole thing was kind of stressful. No not busy at sing. We are. That was back in i think 2004. Because my life has gotten so stressful. To the point where. It was either i had to do something. Or. Or in something to tell you the truth yeah. Yeah i think it's useful to know what's a good sounding board and someone to throw. I know your concerns out and we'll discuss things that may be bothering you was good things to yeah i think therapy with medication. Who have been going to therapy. The changes. A lot of changes. I've been more focused. More. Hopeful. It's just been a good experience for me was just wanting to go. Really happy. Well. I can feel really happy. Buy some occurrence i can't think of anything right now just like that. And then. I go back to how i was feeling. So i can't really pinpoint anything really i mean. I mean something comes to me unexpectedly. Orphans. Go right for chains and continue to go right as opposed to things going wrong all the time. That that makes me happy things go right how about then. Something i did recently. But i really. Riley reiff. I really enjoyed. Being really really enjoyed. Recently. I can't pick up anything. I don't have a best friend. My best qualities. Or that. I'm an honest person. I genuinely give people the benefit of the doubt. Everyone in my book. Is as they appear to be. Until they prove it differently. Very generous. Overly generous. And i'm very i like to help other people. I mean help them come on the personal level and help people. Whatever their problem is it gives me pleasure to do something for somebody else that's helping them out. Everything i regret. How soon. There's only one thing i regret and that is sad. After my twins. Became old enough to. Start going to school. If elementary school level. I was taking some courses as a pre-law major. And. At the time i was married. To their father. Turned out not to be a good. Fit4me. Because of the stresses involved with him. Knowing that that was going and then i was going to leave him. I dropped out of college. That was my biggest regret. Fanschool. No matter what. Baby chorus. No matter what. But i'm a good person. A good human being. Careful. Okay. Goodbye. That's going to go goodbye. Are you done. Okay. I was weird. That was a little weird that was a little nervous. \n",
      "Okay. Yes. Get. New jersey. 5 years ago. That wants a year. And there's more to do out here. The weather is nice. Didn't take very long. Darcy in the music saying there's always something to do out here. Some of the people. Some of the people are just kind of superficial. No. I like it out here. Art. And took a lot of art courses throughout high school. The little. I'd like to create. Not very hard. Outgoing. Because all of my friends tell me i'm outgoing. Listen to music or read. How are you. Pretty good. I don't even remember the last time i argued with someone. I don't feel guilty about anything. I can't think of a situation i wish i handled differently. Probably moving to la. I just decide in the go away from my family and come out here but it's kind of a difficult decision. Yes. It's very good i still talk to them. Like almost everyday and i see them sometime so it works out. My mom. It's kind of taught me to be the person i am today. I can't think of any way i wish i could erase my memory. I like it. No. Series e. Ayanna lott. No. No. No. Whenever i go to the gym i get happy. Yesterday. Crazy. Because i am crazy. I like myself the way i am. I can't think of a time someone made me feel bad about myself. No. I just tell myself that everything's going to be okay. Probably family visits. Everytime i go back it's really nice to see all my family and see what they're up to now. I really enjoy karaoke and i did that recently. When people put down other people. Music. Art exhibits. Working out. My friendships. I'm a good listener. And. Really good at giving my opinion on how to help others. \n",
      "Is that me. Do i talk okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah that okay okay it's better okay thanks. Okay thank you thank you. Hi. Yes. Okay. Los angeles. The weather. The variety of environments the ocean you know various different environment or environmental variety. I don't like the superficiality of people. The narcissistic attitude. Just. The. It doesn't have a small-town sort of feel where you know just the warm the human sort of warmth interactively so yeah. Do you travel a lot. No. Am i have a fear of flying and i have developed agoraphobia. Incredibly difficult. Can you tell me. I'm guessing you mean the agoraphobia more so than the fear of flying. It's it's more of a recent development and. It's. It's progressed it's progressing to be worse it's very what's the word. Immobilizing and very distressing actually. Yes it is. How do i cope with that. Just. Just trying to. Do the best i can and. Try to you know how the most courage i can in the situation and challenge myself and small steps. I read a lot i do bibliotherapy reading. And i try to inform myself of the. Of the professional literature so that i could hopefully over comment someday. Yes definitely. Certain things trigger at like enclosed spaces. Being in a car traveling being away from home being in someone else's car things that are outside of my locus of control. Add actually i don't go to school right now. My dream job is. To be a psychologist. I'm not a psychologist but would make me decide to do that is. Having lived through some challenges like this having lived through some traumas. But i've always had an interest in it since junior high of. I'm very interested in people and in human interaction and human connection and the betterment of of of those things. Bridging people together and helping people interpersonally through their child personal challenges so that's that's sort of it in a nutshell. I think i'm someone who's. I can be very outgoing and sort of warm and friendly presents very easily but i think on the exterior but i think i'm shy and i challenge it to do that i think it hard i'm shy. But i thought i'd challenge myself completely cuz i do love human interaction so i take those risks and and jump and those challenges. Adolescent i interacted with somebody was today. If i think i'm understanding your question correctly. Oh no i think i misunderstand your question but i i interacted with rachel i just i'm continuously interacting with people. Taking those risks. How are. A very good very good. When was last time i argued with somebody. Actually can't remember it wasn't recent. Tell me about. Situation that you wish. I have to think about that i don't know yet let me think. I'm drawing a blank i can only remember things. From what i was like 21 right now i can't think of anything contemporary right right now my mind is. Okay i when i was younger. Yes i lost. A relationship with me. And my uncle and my cousins cuz when i was 21 on 45. I. Had a disagreement with my aunt and i said something that was a critical of her and. She threw me out of their home and. Let me back i apologized immediately and they let me back into their lives. And change their minds. So i regret that. I'm assuming you mean how did i feel when they asked me to never. I've been their lives again. And to leave shattered soul shattered heart shattered. Well that that was my family that was. The good side of my family there's. The majority of my fat they were they were the the loving aspect of my family on the rest of my family is very cruel and very abusive. I'm i don't have any relationship with my family at all like there. Since i was. 21 since my aunt and uncle. Disown me i guess it's the right word. Estranged yeah. Gosh i'm drawing a blank just bear with me for one second. Someday i could erase. Can't even get it to my memory. Doesn't example. I was injured and i wish i could get. That away from my memory. Yeah. I was injured in the emergency room. Doing i went in for food poisoning i was ordered to go in by a doctor i had collapsed and i was ordered to go into the er for food poisoning and i came out injured with a neurological syndrome i was injured with a. What do you call it. Intravenous procedure and now i have rsd reflex sympathetic dystrophy. And it was the scene in the emergency room was it was an out-of-control seeing there was a problem with the procedure and the doctor was yelling at his staff who made a mistake. That and was extremely excruciating it was a a crisis. And so every time i think about. The injury and it was disfigured i got disabled. I got to say before it disabled permanently from it was also disabled from my employment for quite a quite a given amount of time as well. And and it i have residual. Physical trauma from it and disfigurement and. Severe disability disability limited functionality with my right my right hand it my right hand and arm thank you. Artist. I don't even know what that is. You know i i really. I apologize cuz i can't really probably give you the. A most suitable answer. I'm guessing it has something to do with. My cat and her. Urgent. What do you call it. Hurt she was in intensive care veterinary care and i'm sure it had something to do with that. But other than that i would say i had choosing my life path weather. And i was admitted to that program. Or whether i was going to go to art school for 4 years. And i had to pick a life direction but that does not a traumatic situation. So i don't know how best answer your question. How is your day. I can't. I have. Severe nightmares and i have nocturnal. Panic attacks. And i also have physical illness on top of it and i'm in excruciating pain. You have to. Yes. Yes. Yes they're triggered by the injury that i told you. They're triggered by my family. How they've treated me what they've said to me what they've done to me. They're triggered by. What else my my physical illness not my injury only but my physical illness as well. So yes. I feel very ill and feel so fatigued. Very ill and very fatigued. When i don't sleep and get enough sleep at my anxiety level i believe is up and. I'm susceptible to feeling distress so yeah. Have you ever been tagged. Yes. 3 years ago. My most recent diagnosis and in 2001. As well. Yes. 3 years ago and. When i was. 20 years old. What. The my background my childhood. From my family of origin and their. You know the abuse that i went through. And their ultimate. What's the word. Rejection of me and estrangement that was the first reason. No i stopped 6 months ago. Why did i stop i'm just taking a break i'm going to continue. Yes very much. It's helped tremendously. I think it helps with anxiety at helps with. It helps inspire crate inspiration that helps. Feeling connected. It helps to. Create what i ultimately my goal is to. Give myself a voice and. It helps to to it's part of that process it also helps to understand myself to learn about myself. And there's just so many benefits it's i'll stop right there there's many more. Tell me about. The last time i felt really happy. Is it was a really long time ago it was before my illness. And it was in 1997 on the outside of my illness was in july of 97 so it was before that. Yes. I was. In a very good place in terms of my career. I'm in terms of. My just my relationships and everything was just start of at its best. Career relationships personal fulfillment sort of as well i was very active and and doing. I very many things that were mating full to build a life and i was in the process of. Just in the planning stages of my life but also very accomplished at the same time it was just a thing for just going very well and i've just really liked. Just where my life was at it was just in a really good place and many ways. I wish i could change about myself my anxiety. I wish i could change about myself my agoraphobia. Myptsd meeting my trauma and. What else. My insecurities as far as. Just. With other people in the sense that i'm always trying to make sure that that i don't do something that that hold on one second i'm just trying to make sure that i don't do anything that's offensive to them or insults them or is disrespectful and i i feel like i'm overly cautious about that and it kind of becomes an anxiety onto itself. So i definitely think that would be beneficial. At change on the other thing i'd like to change about myself as i wish i could feel. And also depression i'd like to change that about myself i wish i could feel better. I wish i didn't feel. Iso. They didn't have the burden that i do of my family i'm not having one. And what else i wish i didn't have my illness and the physical excruciating pain that i'm in so those are some things and i also wish that. And this is a byproduct of ptse i wish that i didn't have. The. The symptom ology of ptsd is that definitely. Affects one's complete complete lifelike affects their life completely. And i i wish i was more articulate and i wish i was someone who was well-spoken. And some of those ball written. There's many there's many more. Things that i wish i could change about myself to improve myself. So many more. What advice would you give yourself. I'm not sure. Maybe two. Not be so trusting. I trusted. I trusted some medical professionals that. You know again created the injury and. You know where. There's a. What's the word. There's an expectation and it's sort of a demand to just blindly trust the medical profession and. Don't ask questions and just sort of. You know. And if not to trust your own self your own. Your own instincts or intuition. And so i would. I would have told myself to be a little more careful i guess if that's. Useful to your question. What did i really enjoy. And i can't think of anything specific. But. I know it would have to do. With either reading or. Connecting with someone on a meaningful level. I'm most proud of. My compassion. My my empathy and caring about people. Despite i mean i'm proud of it anyways but i'm also particularly i come from an environment that's the opposite i'm a background and that wasn't taught that. But i really do care about people and i'm i guess i'm most proud of that i'm also proud of my career accomplishments and my tenacity my my fierce tenacity to succeed. And. It'll just also to get the strength it takes to get through. The injury. A to live with it and to live with the illness that i live at the physical illness. So i think that would be at. Let's go. Yes. Okay. You're welcome. Bye. Okay i've been crying and opening up to this person so i think i did but what you're what you wanted right i'm embarrassed cuz i got really involved like she was asking questions that you know we're really at the heart of you know some of your pain so. \n",

That needs to be kept with the kids weather if they're eating there. Sleeping their clothes addresses for their content that you have no problems at school or home or at the safe. Physically mentally spiritually everything. My best friend was so she has not changed since high school. Level-headed. But a great sense of humor. Relax. I don't take things too seriously. I love the holidays i love christmas. I love everything about it i love preparing the house for it i love. Baking cooking. Freshly baking i love experimenting with new recipes. Until the last couple of weeks because the holiday season was just here i feel fantastic. Everything is. Quiet i'm not at work i'm not stressed out in any way at all i have no projects do. I have to think about anyway. So christmas time holiday time. Really enjoyed recently. What christmas of course we went to las vegas. 27th of december that was fantasia i stayed for two days we had a really good time. We saw a great show. We have some great food. We drove that we only to drive i don't like to drive a lot. We drove there and just took our time. It was good. It was nice. Goodbye thanks for listening house at 1. I have to ring the bell. My mind is wandering here we go. Hi there. Okay. Actually before i do that let me see if i can do this for you. \n",
      "Actually. Okay when she's done you can press the doorbell okay. Hi. Are you okay. Sure. I'm doing alright. Where are you from. New jersey. Yes. 3 months ago. Not very often. How does it compare to a. It's much different. I don't know it's just it's a lot more crowded here. The song new life for myself. It wasn't very easy at all. It was a. Was quite rough at first but you know i'm still trying to get used to life here. I met some good friends here. And i love the hollywood area. It just you know the mountains are beautiful kind of things i love. The traffic. I'm not much of a. You travel a lot. Not really know i don't. Just haven't had the time or the finances to. Digital media. How did you decide. Well. But i've always loved you know. Computers and you know designing things and it's kind of fell into it. No. I dropped off. You could have wednesday. Virtually made. Well i guess my dream job would be working. And something that. I went to school for and i never really completed my education. But i guess be great if i want you know back to school and you know finished you know my. Degree in digital media. And now you know finished. Start working nina. something that field. Or. A little bit of both. i can be shy at times but. I like to push myself to be outgoing. You know it's kind of struggle for me but. I don't want to be you know in a shell so i kind of force myself to be ongoing. Sometimes when i'm feeling 10. Turn on the fish. I know it's not hawaii. That's a guy. What do you do to relax. Listen to music sometimes just driving. Can i play music in my car and that helps me relax. Or smoke a cigarette. Like what. Stucky middle that's all i listen to is metal. How are you at country. Well. It depends on. How high my stress level is in. How angry i am. But i. I do my best to. Not get so pissed off. And. I don't know if she young. She wanted me to come and pick her up. She was a little drunk. And we just kind of float over the phone over some other things and. I just out of not picking her up. Because of her attitude on the phone with me. Yeah. It does. What's something you feel. Something i feel guilty about not talking to my kids. Often. Or as often as i should. I've just been so busy with china. Get myself all situated here though i don't really have time to. You know talk to my kids as much as i'd like to. You have no idea. It's it comes natural but it's snowy easy. And it's the hardest job that i love to do but right now it's extremely difficult for me because they live so far away. And i made this choice to come out here to la. And i feel bad that i don't see them. You know. But. The reason i came out here was to better myself so i can provide for them. Fear. You know. Just fear what we do you fear what's going to happen to your kids you fear. That. Something awful's going to happen. And. Not seeing them. Brings about that fear lawn mower. You know and i can't make it always be there with them i can't see them. You know what. It wasn't as bad when i was living in florida. And i only things to see them. I wasn't very often but i still used to see them now i don't see them at all. And that's the best the hardest thing i've had. To do as a parent. Astute. Step away from my kids if only temporarily i don't know how long would it be here for. I don't know what my future holds. But. The hardest thing is being. So far away from them. The joy that they bring to me i mean i could be having a bad day. And they just cheer me right up. It sucks being away from them for for so long and they're so far away. And just not seen their faces that's. It's the worst thing ever you know. But. I love to just see their faces if they just bring a smile to my face and. What are some ways that you. Well. I think. The fact that i can. Get down to their level. Goofier. As a father than my dad was with me my dad was. You know strict all the time sure he used to let you know laugh and play with us but. You know he was always very reserved. You know. And he kind of held back like a lot of his emotions just because. You know it was a it was a strong great tough guy. But with me i'm very goofy and silly like it that i'm strict when i have to be. But. Always love to. You know play around with them. As much as possible. You know not. I don't want them to grow up too fast. Let that maybe. Well. Situation that i wish that would have handled differently. There's so many. I guess what i was still with my ex-wife. In florida i wish you wouldn't have. Gotten so angry when i wish i wouldn't have let her get the best of my emotions. Tennessee to. Get underneath my skin. And now you know. Keep picking at me until. I exploded. And. I love her to do that. You know it i should have just. Walked away when i could. And you know now that my temper get the best of me. No. No. No. Sometimes it's hard. Sometimes i just lay awake in bed you know thanking all the things are going through my head all the. All the stress that i'm going through. With work and needle. Making sure. We are wondering if i'm going to i'm going to be able to make you do rent. You know wondering why kids are going through. You know when i'll see them again if they even care about me anymore. If that you know they have a father. You know. Those are some things that run through my head and. And it keeps me up at night sometimes. A little but. You know i put myself in the situation so. You know i got a. Bear with it and i got to. You reap what you sow so like. I got to deal with it in my own way. Lately. I've been trying to. Nothing so much about. It'll all that's going on in my life. I try to distract myself. The kind of. Get me to better mood you know if i'm hanging out with friends or. What's a little tv something to get my mind off. You know. All the stresses in my life. Tell me about the lab. Really. The last time i felt really happy. Was russia couple nights ago i went out drinking with. With a couple of my friends from work and. I don't know. We just got. Pretty drunken. I kind of help me to forget. All the crap that was. Previously on through my head. So if i can distract myself i can forget about all that. Other stuff. But i'm happy. Some of my best qualities i guess unconvincing. Kind of like a. I guess you would say a counselor to some people only answer my close friends. You know. I made talk people into doing things that they may regret or i'm at i'm in shy to talk people out of things to do. And i may end up regretting. Worry babe. You know just listen to people so you know. I can see that you know i definitely know what's my friends and help them out in their time of need. When they're going through something. Troubling times like like i'm going through. Can you give me an example of. Looks in florida. Who do i talk to him every now and then and. He's been having troubles with his girlfriend and. You know i just kind of. Talking about his problems to listen i'm i mainly listen because you know i don't think he has anybody else to listen to. You know when i was living in florida. I was already close with him so you know you can always rely on me. And now that i'm here in la. I don't want to lose that connection with him because i mean i've always been there for him some. Yam. He relies on me too. Listen to this problem giving me some advice. But what i think you know he should do. I think he appreciates that night. And i'm glad that he you know relies on me for that. But he trusts me enough to tell me all that stuff. What are some things you wish. Lol. Sometimes i wish i wasn't so. Kinder jeffress. It seems. Bad but sometimes i don't people may take advantage of me. And i may not realize it. And. I don't like saying no to people i like. To always please people. So if i can change that maybe i wish i wasn't such a people pleaser. Sometimes financially in trouble. Sometimes i you died. Help others in that you know. Let me make me broke sometimes not have enough to. Pay bills but. I feel better helping people. I don't know. I regret. Nut. Breaking up with my ex-wife sooner. Rere. Because she put me through so much crap in my life. I was always trying to. Baby please osuna please her. Eurotunnel. Please my kids as much as i can. But not breaking up you know the family. But. There's only so much one person can take. And i think probably if i would have left sooner. I may have been happier. And things may not have gotten so out of control out of hand like they did. You know. During all those years with her. So. If i would have got out sooner. I don't know why would been happier by guess. It's okay to be selfish. It's okay to. You know. Think about yourself sometimes. You know if you keep putting everyone ahead of you. Then you're not thinking about yourself you're nothing about what makes you happy. Even though. Pleasing people make you happy. You have to think about yourself sometimes too in about your needs. Because. You know. You play an important role. In. The lives of your close family members. And. In order to keep everything afloat. You sometimes get up you got to worry about the one person that's. You know juggling everything and holding everything up which is yourself so. Be little selfish sometimes it's okay. I don't even know what weekend is anymore. My ideal weekend would be. Locked away alone in my room. Watching movies listening to music just. With my. Cell phone off. Not it'll be with anybody or we could be out at a bar. You know. You know watching a metal show. So. I like to be alone. But at times i i do want to be out with that with others i like you know. Being around people. How your best friend is. Crazy. He thinks i'm a. I'm crazy for coming out here. But. I guess you would say that i'm dedicated and then i'm strong-minded. And you know whatever i set my mind so i can do it you know the matter. How hard it is unlikely to wimp out. So. Every night i really respect him for giving me his insight. But i guess yeah i guess you'd say that. Crazy butt. Strong-minded. Like kids. Yeah that's the one thing that brings joy to me you never like real real joy. Are my kids and. You know just let me know in my life is. Products that i could never i was just having dumb. In my life. And although i don't get to see them. This much. You want to think about those thinking about you know. How far they've gone. You know what what they've accomplished in there you know. In the short time it is yeah it makes me happy. And i can't wait to see them again. One of my most memorable experiences. I guess that would be. In florida. You know going to ciara and i fever band skeletonwitch. It was a great night overall you know what one of the nights all never forget. It's because we've been looking forward to it for you know somebody months and. You know what finally happened to the surreal. It was a great night after all and overall. Shark you're welcome. Take the alarm. \n",

      "Earlier. Okay. Okay you're welcome. This. I'm doing fine. I'm from los angeles and born in off and. You have a lot of places to go a lot of people to see. Love things to do. Smog. The government has changed over the years. I've been around since. 1952 and. I was born here in los angeles and i see such changes as far as environmental with the smog. And. Basically that's about it. I've dredged several places in the united states yes. Trying different type of cuisines i like to go to museum like to historical i'm historical buffer. Going somewhere different than where i've been here all my life. I'll let me start with. Ostra boston i had never been to boston before and when i went. I was able to look at the historical the building. And i went to. I saw. The lake charles and then the boats and stuff like that it was just it was a good experience. It's another place i went to i took a ferry it and my mind went on blank on it. God. I can't even think of it right now. But other than that new orleans oven to new orleans. I didn't go to the mardi gras just i don't like to go when it tomorrow to cry when they have a lot of. People. I just went on offseason. I enjoyed that an event atlanta georgia. And i have taken a cruise. I've went to the caribbeans attic mexico cruise. My next cruise i like to go to this alaska. Because i want to be able to see. Certain areas that we haven't destroyed yet. As far as the environmental. I'm outgoing. As far as going places i don't have a problem eating alone. I don't have problem meeting people. I'm only shy in conversing back and forth some stranger. I have a favorite thing i like to go on internet and i like to do sweepstakes. Person that. Love to try to enter a lot of contest and i've been very successful since i was a kid. I've won a lot of sweepstakes and. In the evening time i find our time and i just go online and just. I'm so good at i know just about exactly the right time to even entering i usually try to answer them before midnight when everybody else asleep. So it's been successful for me. Getting married having my children. I have a 27 year old son and i have a 31 year old son before 11 of us married does not. And i just. Not too long ago became a grandmother i have one grandson. And my son he works for the county of los angeles. Property conveyed conveyance examiner. And the other one is a computer engineer. So i've been married for 33 years. And basically you strong. You don't want. If you build a foundation with your children. Have a good relationship with them. And talk to him and find out what's going on and tell them that you love them i have my son i talk to him all the time when they went out the door i love you and even today when they're call me and hang up a set mom i love you. You always have to give them that that. Good feeling when they leave the door. That. Ucare. And i never had to go to. It20 gel to get them out. They've been pretty obedient that mean boys-will-be-boys but i never had any problem. As far as them getting into any serious trouble. And i'm very proud of that for special good boys. I don't know how it would have been with girls and maybe a little different but. I have to say. They're pretty albanian and they respect the law. The best thing is watching them grow and become parents themselves and see what they learn basically from you. And i watched my son like i said just a recent grandmother. And i watch him how he handles his son. And it seems like he's learned a lot from his foundation that he learned at home. Oh how the hell his son to be responsible to go to work every day and he knows that. Hey. I got a wife. I have a son and it's my job to make sure that i keep a roof over their heads. So it pays off. Teresa well. My mother was more stricker on me. But my parents. For some unknown reason i guess because my sister and i were the girls like they weren't strict on the boys but they were more strict on the girls. So they didn't let us go a lot of places and then my parents are so they weren't type that like to travel. And i used to look at them and say no i'm not going to be like them i'm going to travel i'm not going to just stay home and i mean that is nothing wrong with him because they. Download home. And do things at home but they never really travel anywhere and my mom used to was afraid of planes 41. And i used try to talk her and get on a plane and go somewhere and so i'm going to go here i'm going to go there but you never did she died she never did to do any trouble. So i made up for. And i want to do something different than s2 to travel more than and be more out there. I was more of a social butterfly my mother was another social butterfly. So i made up for it. I think before i speak. And i'm not a type of person also too. I take on other people's feelings before i. Blurt out the wrong thing i try to. Analyze the situation first. Because sometimes you can put you open your mouth too soon and you can put yourself in something that you would not be able to get out of. It's probably something about my husband yet. Oh i know it was it's probably almost new construction that my husband is working on our house. We had a disagreement on that. Men have their own way of doing things and. I had told him not to use a certain. Person to work on our house. But because of the personal relationship he has with this person he went on the head. And now he sees all the downfalls. And he didn't listen and so i didn't say i told you so but i guess he can tell by my facial expression. That he'd have done wrong and i told him i said losing money. And it became one problem after another so now i do construction thing is up in the air right now cuz he knows he has done wrong. And i'll bet he doesn't want to face the fact that. Well he knows it but he doesn't want to really face the facts out he says. Mountain project. No it's our project. So i grabbed this one of the biggest argument are we having right now. That i can think of this recent. I feel bad. He didn't really listen to me and he more so look that cheap or economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways cuz i told him. Bad. You need to do your research. I'm the type of person i do my research before i jump into something i have tried to. my eyes and cross my t's. But my husband he's not like that he's fight. I can get this person can do this project for x amount of money. And he's a good friend of mine so i don't care i mean is he license. She doesn't look at all that stuff you could just jump into it. Witch costume some extra money unnecessary money that spent on the in that mean if a lot of money. It's i was really very upset yesterday i was very upset about it because. It was just wasted money. That we could have say can we wind up doing the same thing all over again. And it didn't make any sense. I retired early. I was very fortunate to retire age 50 i retired in 2002. Was working for state of california. It's a disability animas and what happened was i was able to reason why i was able to retire so early because i've been working since i was 18. And i had like 31 and a half years of service. And what was so nice about it that i only needed the best in like 10 years in my health insurance. So i was able to get full health insurance. But the only thing about it when you retire i was with calpers. And i'm nephew from italy counter but. We have excellent retirement system and since i have been working with them so long. I didn't get the full percentage i should have stayed thomas 55 but i got out of that 50 and i didn't get the full amount but that's okay. I found myself going back doing a little part time job. Because of the economical reason and then i have one eye that's so. I think that was the kind of mistake i did i should have kind of waited till i was 55 and 50 but i look at it now as far as the health insurance i really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up. And i don't pay very little money so i think that over the gates of the money that i receive. The hardest. It's probably when my mom died cuz i'm not used to anybody dying. My mother. Died in 99 of non-hodgkin lymphoma. And. Putting her funeral together my brother sister we never we will never face with anybody dying. I put a funeral together and i'll respond because i am the eldest it was put on me. And i'm like oh my god what i do. Is so i was kind of like you left out there trying to find her insurance policy cuz i had asked her to make sure she put everything in order. And she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and try to get all the stuff together and finding things. You know i myself i keep my things organized for some unknown reason she didn't have her sargon eyes. I think that was the hardest and knowing how much i had to pay cuz i had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff. And i'm fortunate my mom this is interesting. She had 10 small barrel insurance but she had million-dollar of accident insurance accident. course with an accident she had a medical condition so that was something that we had to pay for the whole. Just about everything. Yeah it was it was but. And now i can handle that but. Since that i've learned from that so i have made it available for my children. That my husband died we got together. And we want them getting our insurance policy to ensure policy but. What do you call the. Barrel insurance we got that and it just said we've had it for many many years so it's almost payday butts in a 10 years of pay for everything the plot and everything. And nothing i did i've even written my own obituary i know that sounds weird. So my son. Make one phone call that's i don't want them to go through what. I went through. And my husband agreed that's the one thing we did agree on. He said he don't want anybody to have any problem. People coming in and tell him what to do it's already written we did a living trust. It's nothing they can do but make one phone call. That's it. I have no problem sleeping very well. Pretty good. But that's only because the physical condition and i have found i have vitamin b deficiency in vitamin. Deficiency self-defense, but not mental. Exercise walk walking warsaw. No not really. No. No. I'm basically halfway all the time i'm more so i'm making other people happy. I get more phone calls us. People want inspiration about things when they have projects they working on and i try to encourage them. And it makes me feel good when they hang up and say you know hey i really appreciate your input. Thanks. And then they all follow up on them and see how they're doing. Resource person. I've been. Describe as a resource person from my supervisor. To from my friends. Because i'm the type of person i researched everything i get into just about. I just don't dive into any situation i tried to look up information something i know if we have the technology here that you can get everything on the end of that but also go back to the old school like like even finding this place. I mean i did the map google but also i love the thomas brother i've ever going to give up by thomas brothers nap. Yellow pages you be surprised i don't give up by yellow pages so there's certain little things that i don't really let go i know we have technology but. Sometimes she's going to be surprised that you can go around and find a whole lot of stuff. Even though technology did you have it right at your finger but you can find things. And i may say i'm more of a resource person the most people come to me just. Good look up things. And i get that that that's punk about it because i like to look for stuff and find it. And that gives me satisfaction. I wish i could. Lose weight diet before the summertime. And then by christmas time i have what they call a yo-yo weight problem. And if i can stop binging and making food my friend. I think that's just a nervous disorder i acted i like to eat and. But also i don't like to be overweight either cuz i have plenty of beautiful clothes at home. And i can't get them on right now so. I know i said i'm going to go on this bench and try to lose weight for the summertime so i can get another so nice clothes mostly. Not happy with my weight. Yeah. I'm sorry i didn't hear you. No not really i was red. Cuz i can't stay skinny. I guess i regret not being able to keep it and fall back on the way back on. I see you. Like 10 or 20 years ago. I would have stayed a little bit more money before i retire. Basically. Putting away more money before i retire. Instead of retiring too early. What's prophetesses of my life. Meeting a lot of people that came in my life. I got good friends i still have 15 of the best friends that i went to elementary school. And injury where you can find anybody to walk around and say they have the same 15 group of friends we were in the sorority together went to college together lived in the same neighborhood and matter fact we just had all of us and our 6-year birthday and our. High school. Group we put together a 60-year birthday reunions. And here all 15 of us with the exception of one we're all alive and healthy and we keep in contact so i think it's basically keeping the same friends. I think we can probably outlive me. Okay. You're welcome. Bye-bye. Okay. Okay. Alrighty. \n",
      "Yeah i'm okay with it. I feel pretty good. Little nervous. Because i've never done anything like this before that's why. From ohio cincinnati. 2 months ago. 12 months. Just looking for. Going to be in a new environment. O-jama ecstatic. Very happy. Took a few weeks. Just to get adjusted. Cuz i don't know it. The weather is probably the best thing. Yeah i know. Meeting other than that. Pretty much the same as. Everywhere else i've been. It's nothing i don't really like about l.a.. Since you know. The weather is the best part of it. Yeah. I like to travel somewhat i haven't traveled a lot of my life but over the past. A year-and-a-half i've done. Done quite a bit of traveling. Just seeing different places different people new people new faces. New places. Let's see last score last summer i spent the summer in cleveland doing the urban farming. Undercity. Yeah and. I stayed at a hostel the first hostel in cleveland. I was at doing program with the. And it was basically. We would. Go to different urban farms throughout the city and. Volunteer. About 20 25 hours a week. Really a spur-of-the-moment type of thing. Wanted to try something different something i've never done before. A farming is one of those things that you know most people. Would never try. Cuz of a you know cuz of a certain stigma that comes along with it. And you know. I just thought it would be fun and interesting to do something like that. What in the. Urban farming or in general. Urban farming. I don't know i guess. I don't know just. Just the overall experience is going. You know eating. Going to the farmers market and eating all the fresh food and. Just send the difference in. You know how fresh. Natural food taste. That you know. As opposed to the foodie by the grocery store. Yeah it is really this. I was i took two semesters. About college and i was undecided. So just taking general classes. My dream job. That's my dream job would to be. Anything that involves i don't know how to like a specific dream job or anything that involves nature. It's being outside. I would like to. I wouldn't mind being like a like a forest ranger or something like that. Just long as i can.. Yeah. Consider myself more shy. Don't like. Don't know why it's just the way it is. What are you doing. Iread. Listen to music. A draw. Watch movies stuff like that. I think i'm pretty good at it. Yeah. Wow. Yeah i can't remember the last time i hear argument with someone. I don't know. Again i don't know because. Dwell on things that happened in the past. Yeah. Maybe weather tonight to come to california. I guess i was a hard decision. Well. I don't know i've been thinking about it. You know moving to a new place for a long time. And. I guess. The hardest part of the decision was. Thinking weather. Whether or not i will be. Secure or not. You know what i mean. Just going to a new place we don't know anyone. Kind of. Are you really don't know what's going to happen. So. There was a lot of. You know. Fear not. And that decision of. Should i go to a place where i don't know anyone i don't i'm not familiar with the area. Hino. Only. Only perception of a hat that i have of this areas. You know what i seen on it and media media and tv. So you know. Yeah. Guess that was. Hardest hardest decision. That i can think of. I guess so. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Yeah. Nothing. I don't feel guilty about anything. Relationship with my family. I'm not really close to my family. I guess the person. I'm closest to is my mom but you know i don't you know i never really talked to her much. I don't really know my dad that well so. You know. I guess my grandmother. Yeah she. Yes she's. She's very. How should i say it. She's very. To the thinker. I put it like that like she's. Very insightful. So. Y'all look so hard. For a lot of advice because. She's been through a lot through a lot in her life. I feel like she you know she's been through a lot so she understands a lot. Uno. She's very positive influence. Very easy. Baby unsure. I would say. Because. Right now i really don't know. What direction i want to go in. With my life. And it's been a lot of confusion with that. But. You know it's not. It's not something that overly affects me but you know it's always a thought in the back of my mind feels like. Somehow. Maybe i'm running out of time. And i know that's not like. That's not that's not a realistic thought because. I don't see how you could ever run out of time. But. Yeah i guess yeah. Just general. Not knowing what i want. But i know a light. How do i cope with that. How do i cope with that. I don't know i just do a lot of thinking. A lot of soul-searching. It's not hard i mean. Let me know. Like i can't say it's hard because it's one of those things that. I feel like it's necessary. And. You know certain things in life you just. You're forced to face. So. It's harder to i think it's harder to avoid. Those type of things. No. No. No. Let me today. When i talk. When i talk to my friend earlier. Yeah. How would my best friend describe me. I guess you would say i'm quiet. If you describe me as a nice guy. This insightful. Goofy. No i don't really think like that. No. 10 or 20 years ago. I guess i would tell myself to. Stick with with what stick with what i love. Audited. Acting workshop. Enough. Get. I don't know if i've always been interested mine. And i decided why not. No try it. So you like it. We're most proud of. Like an event or accomplishment. Guess i pride myself on being independent. Bye. Okay. \n",
      "Okay looks like we're good. let's move around a little bit make sure that the connecting picking you up. Just got isaac pure pressure and can totally alt alter anything appearances tried to put into a child.. \n",
      "Chat look like straight up there or. Our look at the screen. Okay. Okay. Alright. Okay thank you. Yes. I'm doing okay. I'm from los angeles california. The food. The weather in the people. I don't know it's not too many things i really don't like about l.a. maybe. Some. Of the bad people or some of the bad environments in la. No not too much. I only been like to texas. Las vegas. And. That's pretty much it. Catching the airplane to houston texas like back and forth to visit my dad. And. Going to las vegas today. That's. Oh yeah well. When i was younger i used to go visit my daddy cuz he used to live in houston texas and i used to catch the airplane a lot. And that was a lot of fun i wasn't scared that was a lot of fun. And i. Enjoyed that. When i went to school i studied child development. And nursing. I know i wanted to be somebody and when i went to school i wasn't sure what i wanted to be. So i kind of took. Nursing the lvn program first. And then i didn't want to be a nurse so i changed my major to child development and i graduated from that. No i'm actually looking for work i'm unemployed right now. My dream job will be. Probably doing something working with the kids opening up a nursery or something my own business. In my mind is simple but like in reality it seem like it's kind of difficult. Sometimes i'm shy but i'm really an outgoing person i'm a people person. To relax i listen to some slow music. kind of like. Have a quiet environment. And maybe lay down watch a little tv or something. I'm very good at controlling my temper. I don't like to give really angry or upset. Or. Get to wear. I'm going to hurt somebody. When i really have arguments there like because people don't agree to disagree. And it's like really petty it's like. We might say it's just like my opinion and they don't agree with my opinion so we argue about that. But it's like nothing really big or anything like that just stupid i don't even remember. Probably not working right now i need a job. Yes. Maybe. I don't really remember situation i'll try to really think before i really handle a situation and i try to handle it in a my best positive way. Before i really do something i regret. Being with somebody like guy you know if i want to continue a relationship with them. Or just. Be single. My relationship with my family i don't have. I just really stay with my dad and i have a daughter. And we just stay close all my family they're either in. Houston texas. Or. They're around but i don't really socialize with a lot of my family. My dad. Because i live with him right now i've been staying with him maybe about. 526 years. And. He's just the only one i really look up to i don't really have nobody else around me to really look up to and. That's it. She's in a fifth grade she's graduating she's going to the. Sixth grade and i'm kind of excited for that. Sometimes it's easy but. Sometimes it gets a little overwhelming. The hardest thing about being a parent is being a single parent. It's just you always have somebody to bring you joy i enjoy always doing things with my daughter. Is this about making a lot of sacrifices and just always. It brings me so much joy being a parent. Well. My parents when i was younger. They. Lived apart so my mom. I don't know i'm i'm a much better parent cuz i'm more interested about what my child wants to do i'm involved in our lives. Her every step. Just. I'm really fully involved my parents wasn't really that involved you know they had a drug problem. So just. At the. Mature a lot faster than a lot of other kids. I was. Just. My parents and. Their drug addiction i wish i could erase that from my memory. Now i cope with them. Well but when i was growing up. It just was rough it was very rough. How to. Do a lot of things on my own. They wasn't involved in my decisions in life you know i just. I didn't know how to really grow up and be a kid and which way to go or anything is just like. I was in the world by myself. So it's very easy actually will every night i couldn't sleep. Anytime i sleep very well. A little sad but most of the time i'm very happy i'm just mad. Happy with where i am in my life right now. Not really i really try to think very positive and try to do whatever i can every day to look for work and. Just stay positive and focus. No i haven't. No i haven't. The last time i feel very happy was when i graduated from college. I feel very happy that was one of the best things that happened in my life and. That was the last time i was really really very happy like that. I feel like i was on top of the world i feel like. Just. Overwhelmed with joy just. Everything was just so exciting for me that day i was just very very happy nothing can make me upset that day i was very. Happy and when i think about that day it is. It's a very happy experience for me. Right now i don't really have a best friend. I really tried to. I tried to eliminate a lot of my friends because they wasn't really. Making a lot of positive choices so right now i'm just like. I really don't have any friends right now. My personality. A happy person i'm an outgoing person. And. A positive person. And. A good mother. Insecurities like sometimes i feel like. I have a lot of weight on my shoulders or something i feel like i can't get through something i can't. Get to the next step sometimes or. Just. Feeling down. Sometimes. Well i did have a friend and she was like bipolar. And i tried to really be your friend no matter. The disease she had. But. She was in a really good friend because she. One day she store. Being very negative and just talking about me like we were enemies and everything. In. Didn't really make me feel too bad about myself but it just made me pick my friends very wisely. Yeah just being friends with certain people that don't have positive things going on with themselves or just. Don't it just when i notice things about people that should determine whether i want to be their friend or not you know they might have. Bad qualities or just some bad habits they might smoke cigarettes or drink and i should notice that that's a red flag and i shouldn't be these. People friends. Yeah. To stay in school. Stay positive stay focused and surround myself with good positive people. And just. Stay on the right track. Well i went. To a friend's house that i haven't seen since childhood. And they. Is it a lot of people over there. And they had a barbecue and everything and i really enjoyed. Seeing my old friends that i didn't see in a long time. And just being with. My family and. Certain friends i really enjoy because i'm really always in the house i really don't go out that often. So just i enjoy being with. A group of friends and family and having a good time. Yeah. I'm proud. Dad. I did get my ged i did graduate. And i do want to be somebody and i'm very proud. That. I want to be a better parent than my parents. Thank you. Goodbye. Okay. \n",

      "Move around a little bit. Okay my arms. Virtual humans will chat with you for a bit. And then she'll let you know when. You guys are done okay. Okay. Alright then. Yeah. I'm okay. Come chicago illinois. At my husband's work was here. + 84. It was not easy for me it took about three years. I'm just a movie moved away from my family so i was uncomfortable i didn't know anyone here and even though i did. Make friends i just felt out of place. Not as often as i would like i used to go back at least once a year but in the last few years that's diminish so i would say like every 3 years. The weather. I love the weather the beach. 80s i've been here as long as i have the people have some nice people here. The people some of the people yeah also. Oh i would say the economy. It's very difficult to make it here in los angeles. Business. Then computer graphics. I'm not working it right now. I'm working in retail. I just couldn't find work. And so i had to settle for doing that for right now. It's very tough. I would like to be a human resource representative. No. I like to talk to people too much. And. When i understand right i know a lot about a subject i can go on and on about it and i'm interested in finding out about people if i'm sitting next to somebody else strike up a conversation with them just to find out who they are and. Just do you know i'd like to talk to people i enjoy it. I'm quiet. Rude people. People that hurt children in the elderly that makes me very angry. At war. I control my temper. I don't have a problem with that i just get quiet when i feel angry and i try to think before i act. The last time i argued with someone was about a month ago. And it was with my daughter. And i was arguing with her over her therapy. She has cancer and she wasn't telling me enough she wasn't giving me enough information and so that made me very angry. I was frustrated and angry. Yeah it was very hard. No. Watching your children fail when they're trying hard or seeing that they can hurt themselves and trying to. Prepare them for that when they won't listen to your advice. Oh i feel like sometimes they need to trust me more. The love of my children. Sam. When i was playing with my granddaughter and there was about a month ago. Very excited and happy and just all my cares were gone. I wasn't thinking about anything except for having fun with her so it was a good time. Yeah it's the best. No. Yes. It was over 5 years ago. I couldn't function. I couldn't drive i couldn't sleep i couldn't eat. If i couldn't do anything i was completely. Shutdown. I felt like i felt like i was looking out a window and and life was going on outside that window and i was just stuck behind the glass ii couldn't participate. I knew something wasn't right. But i. Lately i've been feeling depressed. I haven't had a good night sleep in. A year i would say. My regular pattern is to maybe sleeping. An hour up to 3 hour intervals and it just keep waking up but i never quite get into a deep sleep. Groggy. And i have no energy. It's very hard because it's difficult to work. It's difficult to concentrate i make mistakes and i forget a lot. Yes i do. Yes. No i'm not in therapy right now. I could not afford to continue. I'm sorry what. I'm not sure. Yes. I i feel more relaxed and. I feel like some of my worries are lifted from me i have a. I can think clearer because i am using the tools that i've learned through therapy. My children. I don't know. Friendly. I think it's just horrible. I feel that. The children are so neglected. Today. And it's not the fault of the parents i think that dumb. I think that we as a society we forgot that it takes a village to raise a child in. Nobody wants to pitch in no one wants to help anymore no one's helping their neighbor and it's very sad. I don't know. Eating dinner with my family. I regret not spending enough time on my education. I had children very young. So i needed to. Yeah i needed to take care of them. I'm sure i could have. To seek help. My grandparents. I'm just they introduced me to church and. Just you know letting me play at their home and play in their garden it just showed me a lot of love and. And i felt like i was cared for. No. At listening to music. Watching funny program on tv. Going to school working. Go to dinner. What's up friend. Over a year ago. My friend. Do work. Very close. You're welcome. Bye. Okay. \n",
      "My hair is all messy. Okay. And please. Are you okay. Yes. I'm fine thank you. Where are you. Detroit michigan. Yes. I moved to la myself. In 2007 but my family came here many more years ago more like 40 years ago. I don't go back to detroit anymore. I really don't like the weather and i really don't have any reason to most of my immediate family is out here in california. How does it compare. Completely different. For me detroit was just very cold if it wasn't. The best for my personality i prefer la more open space. Warmer climate warmer people. Just a different. Different vibe. That i that i like better. After my husband and i relationship ended i have family out here so i thought it would be easier. To start over here then some of the other places i have lived. Order stay where we were at. Extremely easy i came out here every year to visit while i was in college so i was extremely used to it. Plus i'd also. Taken six months out of off of school and lived out here. And it went to school out here so i was completely used to it. Like i said the weather is number one and it's just. Less crowded it's more open. Space itza. Comer friendlier vibe. Less rushed. The smog would be one. And when i drive the traffic. In certain areas it can be but. In general. There's not a lot but i don't let's like i guess the overall threat of earthquake but that's. Isn't really that much of a factor cuz it rarely happens. The price of real estate. That's another one that i don't. Literally like. I'm sure you can tell them. I can't see your shoes i can't see your shoes at all. So. I don't travel as much as i used to. But i have traveled. Worldwide. What do you enjoy that. New experiences. Well i used to be an international flight attendant and then later i traveled. Through my work as a cruise line and as international sales account executive so. I travel a lot of different places and. Have to say they were. Call pretty-much enjoyable cuz. You know there's different cultures different things to see do learn. Enjoy xperience. My experiences i was saying. Europe visiting more so i've also visit it. South south america jessica sculptures are so very different. Or. I was probably say more shy in general. Compared to people who i know are really really outgoing. Although. I've had them describe me as outgoing. I know it's not hawaii. But it's defensive guy. What are you doing. I like to read i like to walk or power walk or hike. Listen to music. I'm very good at controlling my temper. So. Probably when i was. Married with my husband many years ago it could be many things i don't even know a specific but just anything in general pretty much. Could turn into a debate argument with him. It could be it could be your choice of. Some of the instances when i might have been with him and i. You don't got emotional work. Let it bother me that he made such a big deal of something rather than. Just. You know. Saying it is. Not something to respond to perhaps but it was always be where you were also pushed to answer so. You know you can always just say ignore a person there cuz many times it's just a matter of ignoring situation and it doesn't escalate. But some people. You know what don't respond to the so-called norm. If you ignore it. They'll just you know deescalate but that's not always the case. I taught middle school kids and you can try calm. Message with them but that doesn't always work but you always have to use the teacher maintain. You know your professional demeanor so you can't really. Even when you know the kids do something outrageous or possibly dangerous to themselves or the kids so. Well that could be. Several. I guess it is stationed in. Long as my mom deciding to let a relative have surgery. That you know the outcome was uncertain it could go either way. And in that case. She died so. I know. That's a pretty hard decision cuz you don't know but you also know if you don't. But it could be very serious. I'll come for them as well. How many different things that could occur you know in life you always are second-guessing things that you might could do but. They also can be learning experiences so isn't necessarily a good thing to. Erase them you know if. You can look at his positive sometimes people can have a strong reaction and they don't really look past the. Impact. Of the event. Cuz there might be something that. You can gain from that. But there i grew up in a home of. Dysfunction so there was. Just domestic. Abuse. You know and. There are many incidences so you can't just say only one cuz there is lots of traumatic things. But it also would have been a different outcome and say learning to deal with some of the things. But occur in life is an adult that. Sometimes i see among acquaintances or friends at. Have not had really strong experiences. Fall apart or just have very very difficult times dealing with so. You can listen you know you can and i cuz i understand that not everybody said the same experience you know you can. Walk them through. Levels of. Understanding and you know. As you know someone. You have a balance of background information on. Which to help them pull from in to see that you know things will. Progressed. In a better way knowing that this isn't like. The end of the world or is terrible as it seems that it could be. And you can also relate other experiences to them. How's things at work. Worser. You do seem to be and of course is always in general i mean. When you look at all the calamities in the world. You know most of those things aren't affecting. Oscar the people that we know here. So that provides. As perspective that. You know can pull someone out of there. I don't necessarily say self-absorption but the seemingly. Intensity of their experience right at the moment. Family. Well we have a. Good relationship they. For the most part there are different levels of. Stress and trauma that some of my siblings have experienced so it is. Made them interact with life and people you know more intensely than others. Some if not had. As much. Experience. In life that will help them deal with things you know what a different way. So it's always evolving. And i. Walk and positivity as a lead of. You know. The way i respond to. Tryan engender. More positive. Response. From them. Rather than. Feed. Sometimes the. Very strong reactions are responses or any reactions that they may have. Pardon. I didn't i didn't hear you could you repeat. My mother different teachers friends. Can you tell me about that. Well my mother is always been a very calm. Person with the most part easygoing even though she's experienced a lot of. Negativity i've had. Teachers that have been. Very. Pug positive and proactive. And have you no taught independent thinking and techniques to rise above some of the things that. Recurring. I just. Various friends that you know i would see handling. Situation sometimes. March much more more difficult you know dealing with things. It depends for the most part it's. You know pretty good. It depends if i'm dealing with a lot of things or studying or. You know. Trying to get more hours in the day cuz i need to get things done then you know it's less but. In general i don't have a problem sleeping. It's just. If i make myself stay up stay up because there's more stuff that i want to get done. I've been feeling okay but less you know stressful and general it goes in general cuz i've got several projects i'm working on so. But in general good. Have you noticed any changes. Like. I mean. Not in particular. I mean i just seen. Less stressful as i get more stuff done and the stress comes from sometimes are being a lot more things to do. In a shorter period of time but. Rideau reorganizing. Some of the. Things that need to be done you know ken smooth that out. Have you ever been. No i haven't but i know it's something that a lot of. Say veterans are particular have people have. I have not know. Tell me about the last time you saw. Well there's several i guess. And happiness comes in. Small or large things but in general everyday everyday everyday every moment to me is i mean every day every morning is great wonderful you know day of happiness. As far as big. Celebratory kinds of things i don't have. Highs and lows like that i think it's something that should be on your continuum. You know. Everyday you can be a really great meal it could be a great view it could be. You know i moment shared with someone you know so. This should be an even on an even keel. Tell your best friend. As. Perseverant. You know i will continue for sand. And. Positive. Upbeat. Maybe not doing. Things differently when i were younger like spending my money differently or or spending my. Time you do a little bored differently but that's hard to say it's like okay as your kid older you can see. You know you could have done some things differently. Instead of buying. The house i did what if you know waited and bought another one of me things like that. I would have. Made myself moved california sooner and. I would have. Instead of buying the house that i bought then if i known i would. Would have you know the situation i have now waited to get something different but you know how can you you know have that hindsight you make the best decision that you can at the time. With the best information available. You know after you have looked at several options. Being. Independent and. Educated ableton. Take care of myself. Okay. Albino. \n",
      "Okay great. Fake therapist osha talkback oh my gosh how. And i'll explain after. Just like nobody like making her do anything. Are you can tell me later okay. So what do i do to see what she says. Okay. And you said if i don't want to answer i can just i don't want to answer. The wild okay cool thank you. Okay. Okay. Atlanta georgia. In 2006. Never. I don't like it there. It's completely boring a. There's very little to do. La. It's preferable i think to most places. Because i was engaged to my fiance and we lived in florida i moved there to be with him and. He loves the water. But i love the mountains and i missed hiking and i love florida. And he wasn't tied to it so we decided we wanted to go somewhere we can both be happy. And also have. More opportunities in business and. All of the great things that i have to offer. Very easy. There's not much i don't like about l.a. i love la i think it feels magical. So many creative different people. Of all ages. Shapes sizes colors races. The mountain. Some water. The city all the things that there are to do all of the different people there are to meet i just. I love everything about l.a.. No. I'd rather not talk about it. I didn't go to college. I'm still figuring that out. I don't know it may have something to do with animals i have a dog that i really loved and i never had a dog. As an adult i had cats and. I think i'm a late bloomer so i'm working on that whole conversation i don't. I really don't want a job i want. A purposeful. Way to create wealth not just something to make money in the long run. It depends on the situation but in general i consider myself more scheib although most people would consider me to be outgoing. What do you do. Put on classical music music classical music. Play with my dog. Go for a walk. I think i'm really good at controlling my temper. For the most part. Before i came here. It was just about. Financial stress. There's probably a lot of examples i think i'd rather move to another question. Yeah i'd rather not talk about that either. I rather not talk about that. Very easy at all. I'm a lot better recently but. I have a history of chronic insomnia and some health problems so. It's challenging. Not to feel rested most of the time. In the past week i've been feeling a lot better. Yes i. The weather has changed spring has sprung a little warmer as having. More trouble with my depression in the winter and. Having trouble with. Tolerating. Cold. And so i wasn't. Doing a lot of the things that i normally do. And i also was sick with the flu. And in the past week i decided that i was feeling better enough that i needed to kind of get out of my rut. And start. Getting more focused around things that i need to do during the day and walking my dog. Everyday and. Not isolating so much. Sing some of my friends more so i was feeling. I've been feeling a lot better like i've been making progress and. On that. In the past week things have taken a more positive turn. No. It's been quite some time. Officially. Probably been. I don't know exactly but let's see. Maybe more than 15 years ago. Are feeling suicidal. No. Because i found a better. Alternative. I've been there be off and on since i was 18. And i've tried. A variety of. Methods. And then i started working with a neural linguistic programmer. And. That was really the first person that. Helped me. Make permanent changes and i was able to get off my antidepressants as well and even though i've struggled with some bouts of. Depression it's never been anything. Extremely severe and. I was. One of the best things that ever happened. Well i was. Physically ill. Chronic fatigue syndrome and i had a client. That referred me to this person. Because. He had cured her of that. Disease and. That was. Patriots multiple. Issues and so. Everything is interrelated so. Once i had my first conversation with him i knew it was the right step for me. I'm so happy. I felt like i said. I felt that. I found the answer that i've been looking for that. I had given up hope. Panda. Like i'm glad 9 that i had been suffering for a long time and i felt that i finally. Found. Mansur. To the. Solution that i was looking for was like. Arrest thing i ever did in my life or the best decision i ever made. Extremely helpful. For the first time in a long time. I went to. I went to a music store. Because i've been thinking about. I'm taking up an instrument. I used to play the violin as a child and. I've been wanting to do something. That would give me more access to my creative side because i felt it's been extremely repressed. Enough. And i went to the music store to try out. To see what it would feel like to. To handle it the instrument again. And see if i thought. But that was something that i would want to pursue. It was awesome. Yeah i'd rather not talk about that. Well. That's probably a lot but. I'm always working on being more optimistic. It's been challenging it takes time but. I wish i could hear my own. Internal voice better. Yeah i have regrets. Value myself more so that i would make better. Relationship decisions. My fiance is the most positive. Person in my life. My. Ultimate supporter. I think very unique not the. Not at all selfish and the. Probably a little too giving for his butt. Has my best interest at heart. Has the highest morals of anyone i know. Would give somebody the shirt off of his back. Is a genius. So many ways and. I'm pretty lucky i think. That. I'm not a quitter. That despite some very stressful circumstances over long periods of time i haven't. Giving up on. Taking risks and. \n",

He's over here so that's the best part. What about you oh yeah. I would say. The smog. Yeah the air intake be cleaner. And. Yeah. Desperate i mean. Is good people bad people into but yeah for the most part it's all good. Yeah i've been in mexico and the temples. And woodland california so yes. Traveling. Like tina are that's good it's okay for a body cleaner blood flow the people culture. And stories mean comeback you sure stories was like your friends. Yeah anytime like right now. Orland. Okay so i just one time i was a kid we went out to the temples. And i'm it started raining. So we just start walking through in like when we get to the top one thing i didn't know before is that the higher you go. Does the smartest ats get. So like people back then had on smiley feet. So what happened was. Si went higher towards the temple i had to walk sideways. So my feet can measure up to the steps. But once you get up there it's a nice view. I yeah. General education but. Mini-art. Yeah i took a lot of our classes. Well when i was a kid i scribble and wallace with crayola so i figured you know like it kind of stuck around with me so. Has pursued it song yeah. My dream job. Would be to get paid for painting. Painting art. Yeah. Yeah. Presenting. It's not so much that it's hard it just requires passion. Persistence. And faith and well. You just have to really believe in yourself then we believe yourself the more likely you are able to succeed. I consider myself to be shy and certain time and places. Outgoing when. Like i have the energy. So. I feel like it's well-balanced you know like i'm shy when it's. I guess. Okay to be shy. You know. And i'm outgoing when. Like the need to actually. Have fun or just explore feels good like. If that makes sense but yeah. Yeah. 2 hour relax. Either well i'm going to say this but i smoke weed. So that helps and i like painting painting fema shelton relax. You know especially when i get to color blue because i could have blue on relax me. Jennifer green. When i use these two colors and make a painting a cone cones me down. I didn't have a blue shirt yeah. My temper. Well my thoughts. A my thoughts control my emotions. And my emotions. Yeah. Fema town. My temper is it worth getting mad. Or if i do get mad what would be the outcome. You know. So. Control my temper is just. Play cleaning my thought. The last time i argued with somebody. Was with my with my father. And it was because i wanted to eat food but he wanted me to buy wine. So right when the food was ready i was hungry. So that kind of frustrated me. And. The way i handled it was like well. I could just eat when i come back and i'm doing him a favor so. You know. And then after you not to just eat and eat and peace. So. Yeah. My family. Pretty good. My mom and dad have a good relationship and still married. And my brothers and sisters. We help one another out. So that's good it's just. Yeah it's a good team. A situation i wish i could handle differently would be. A good question. I mean. Can i get a scenario. Okay. Situation. Kind of differently. What's that sting i feel like if i'm calm in any situation i can figure it out. You know if it came down to like a rubik's cube maybe. The situation would be just by. I'll feeling i'm feeling making mistakes. Because i make the right mistakes in the right lessons will come after. So that's the best way i could answer your question. You know. Yeah. The positive influence. Prima's. Anybody who told me the truth has been a positive influence. Influence. You know. Like. Yeah you been doing me hurt like all the truth does hurt. Well they're not trying to be mean that actually. Good influences i will see my friends. My mom and dad. My brother and sisters. Yeah. What's the theme like. I have i've had some pretty bad experiences with like being at gunpoint and with a knife. But at the end of the day with that did was like give me more insight may be more aware and it taught me how to read people a little bit more like. Defense things out and also how to avoid situations so even though it was bad and it did kind like. Scar me. It did prepare me for like the world you know because it's happened to me when i say. 12-13 years old wxpn supposed to like. You know like guns nice and all that stuff so. It's. It's bad that it's good in a long-term you know because. If you get out of that slump. It's like. Nothing else would really phase you because you thinking i had i all i've been through worse so it's not as bad you know. And. So yeah. The hardest. Man. Listen right now actually like the one i got stuck i like kind of think i was part of it. But hearts decision as far as like life-changing. Life changing. What is a continuous school. College. Or not. I kind of chose. Do i. I went to school but i chose to pursue my own like. Like i'm there any more advice can i give myself with people who are already in the field i want to be in. So that was a hard choice because there was no guarantee that i would. Like. Run into like the right people. But i'm at the right people so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Actually really easy. Sometimes yeah like the wind chill out to sleep right now in like 10 minutes you know. I just like sit down my leg has come down. Like like soda my air pattern. Yeah. Lately. I've been feeling. Good. I've been feeling like i have free will like at this point in time i feel like. If i chose a path any path. With a. My heart i could. Get there you know but i'm kind of like still deciding it's like everything in august pass are in the air which i make my own i don't know that's why i meant i feel like i have free will. Oh yeah. Ladylike in the past 2 weeks or today. Okay. Yeah you know like. Yeah things happen that would change like. My feelings and. Example right now they just happened. Right now like. This experience for one is kind of like a shift in my thought. Because. Yeah it's like. It's technology you know it's like it's a trip to see how far. Like. Want to take a thought and then make it. Reality. So that's kind of like shifting my thoughts right now. This experience has this whole experience. Yeah. Post-traumatic stress disorder. No. Depression i know how it's like to be depressed. Diagnosed by dr. no. Depression. How it feels. How depression feel like. It feels like. It's like a bird in the cage. Depression is like. Being a fish who can't swim in the water. I feeling depression is like being a bird without wings. Pretty much feliz. Like you're limited. If anything is. To get out of that depression. If i get to. A weekend and change of perspective. And focus on. Like i would say colors colors help. And people talking to people helps. Yeah. Being depressed. 16. I don't know. Like it could come like it to happen everyday like it's small doses doses. So. Like i could say today you know earlier when i was just by myself i felt a little depressed. Then what happened i fixed it like. I caught a friend and met up with him. I mean at this moment i feel pretty happy you know i'm talking to a virtual person is pretty cool and. Yeah. Right now if you happy. Sometimes hard-headed. Like you would try to teach me. A certain lesson whether it's our. Or just like my character. And. Yes you're fine just described me as like. Like. Like. Listen at the same time he'll still do what he wants to do. But it's so pretty much like. I don't know. Yeah, that's what he tells me but yeah overall good person. I just exercised. My diet food my food intake. Health. I would say when i was like in middle school. Or. In elementary. Littleton high school 2. But why. Yeah it would be was it would either be about. Will pumas. Like it right there something nice i was good then someone else be like all you know that looks kind of like. Like trash and then i'll be like oh. Then. He that could accept and be like yeah just kind of looking then fix it. Or why would do back then we'll be like damn you know you cannot dwell on that thought. And then just like. Stay there for a bit and then eventually i'll come out of it. But yeah you should respond people's words. And ideas. That. Yeah. Yeah sunset. Regret. Yeah i got a couple things i regret. Like what. Well. Sometimes i feel like i should have completed the whole university thing. But. I mean at the same time i feel like. Ever really wanted to go. I would have gone. So yeah. That's kind of regretting my head. 1020 years ago would be on seek spiritual. Wellbeing. You know. Learn how to handle your thoughts to myself. Pick the people you surround yourself with because that definitely has a major influence in your environment assertive vince you experienced. And as far as your overall happiness. Yeah. Among other things but yeah. When i'm most proud of right now. Is my paintings. I pray that because like i feel like these things are releasing our things that no one else could duplicate. You know it's like it's one-of-a-kind in like it's is there you know. It says on signature so. So yeah i'm pretty happy about that. Yeah thank you. I thinking. Alright bye. Yeah. \n",
      "Okay cool. Yes i am. I am pretty good. I was born in los angeles california. Yes. I like the fact that everything is close by all the stores the shops. The traffic. I've traveled but not too much. Going away from your usual days exploring you sites. Three weeks now. a month ago i went to las vegas. With me and my friends and we just went sightseeing. In las vegas we went to the hoover dam. And it was breathtaking. The it was really big and we saw the big canyon and it was impressive i've never seen something like that before. I studied nursing. I graduated two months ago. So i took my board exam to be licensed and i passed so i'm just waiting for my license in the mail. My dream job is to be a registered nurse. Long time ago when i was a little boy i got injured. And my parents had to take me to the hospital. And the doctors came by and they had to stitch me up on the leg. And i saw all of that and that made me want to pursue the medical field. Yes i am very happy. My relationship with my family is okay not good not bad it's if it's in between. I am close i am very close to them. If i have a problem i i go to them for help. Someone who's been a positive influence has been my best friend since elementary school. Yes. Yes we've known each other since we were in the third grade. And we've we've gone to elementary middle school and high school together. Annie lives like 2 blocks away so he's basically like like a brother of mine. I am shy. I really don't know i've always been a quiet person. Ever since i can remember. What do i do i. I going to my room i turn my ac on. And i just relaxing my bed. How are you. I am pretty good i'm pretty good at controlling my temper yes. The last time i argued with someone. Was about. Work. I was disappointed. Not angry just disappointed. Because. My manager. He wanted me to. Do something faster than what i usually can handle. And he already knew that. My workload was a lot but he didn't understand that so that made me just very like sad. I cannot remember one. The hardest decision. I ever had to make was. Dropping out of school. I felt that i didn't really belong. Far away from home. And so. I was just thinking ahead i was in a major that i didn't really like. And so. I decided to just not go next semester and go back home to la. Right now that i'm looking at it yes i am very happy that i did that. Because i wouldn't have gone to nursing school and i wouldn't have been a licensed vocational nurse right now. I don't have an event. It depends on the days where i work or where i don't work. Yes. Right now i i work at at a retail store early in the morning i. I go at 3 in the morning. And i get out at 10 a.m.. So it's really hard for me to get a good night sleep. When i don't sleep well i can be a little bit grumpy. Irritated or just frustrated with the situation. Lately i've been okay i've been good. No i have not. No. No. The last time i was really really happy and excited was when i found out that i passed my license board exam to be a nurse. My best friend would have just would describe me as a caring nice sweet shy quiet guy. Physically speaking i would change how i look from the outside. I overweight. And i would like to. Justin whalin just look good from the outside. I don't have one. No i don't. Just one time. At my work it's a retail store. I. Kind of took. The merchandise without buying it. It was a risk that i took. But. Since no one was around and. Dfd opportunity was right there for me to get it i just got it and i took it home. I don't know. Yes last weekend i went to i went yard selling with my family. It was pretty fun going out to different yard sales and. Finding random stuff. I bought this big black bean bag it was huge and it was. On it was only for $2 and so i got it. And now it's in my room and i said on it. I am most proud of is the fact that i am a nurse. That i am a nurse. I'm just waiting for my for my license in the mail and. After that i would just send out my resumes to different hospitals and nursing homes. Bye. \n",
      "Thanks. I'm doing pretty good. I'm from oklahoma. Yep. Oklahoma city. The weather is great i love being near the ocean and the palm trees and. Mountains. I just love it here. It's pretty easy there's a few differences the huge city compared to where i'm from so the traffic has definitely been an adjustment for me. I just always wanted to live in california hated being landlocked in oklahoma and just wanted to get out to the west coast be near the ocean. I studied psychology and minored in art. No not at the moment. Well actually. I think i misunderstood your question i'm not still working on my degree but i am working in the field of psychology. I just got hired working at a group home for teenage boys who have. Been in trouble with the law. My dream job. I don't really know i think i just want to help people however i can and. I just like working with people in the realm of psychology so i think i may already have my dream job. To relax i like to read watch movies i like to go to the beach and just watch the sunsetter. Hang out with friends. Things that make me really mad. Probably injustice towards other people. People being mistreated or abused. And. People being lied to and deceived. Including myself i hate being lied to. When i'm annoyed. Depends on the situation but. I tried to just. Like count to ten and take a deep breath and and not. Let my emotions caused me to react in the negative way so i just try and like. Calm down before i say anything. It depends again on the situation and like who am angry with most of time i'm pretty good at controlling it but sometimes i think like. Like most people lash out at the people that i'm close to at times and those moments i'm not that good at controlling it. When was the last time an arg. Was probably with my parents. I've been having some. Some car trouble lately and. I'm also running low on money so i'm sure i don't even remember exactly what i'm sure we kind of probably thought about the fact that. I you don't need to be more self-sufficient and independent. Take care of my own things like car issues. I'm very close with my family they're still in oklahoma but i talked to them on the phone all the time. Oh. Definitely i mean. My mom i think. She's probably person that i'm closest to and. She just. She's a great role model she's a wonderful person and she's very hardworking and very unselfish and i just want to be like her in those ways. Probably. The time i went bungee jumping over the nile river and uganda. I still kind of have flashbacks of that moment just free falling it was like the coolest experience ever and i. Love doing things that are crazy like that so it was a fun time. Yeah well i i have traveled a lot nowadays i don't travel so much anymore but i used to work for a cruise line. Norwegian cruise line so i would go. Trouble all the time with them and then i also did an 11-month long trip around the world. The mission trips i just went and. Helped out in different third world countries is really cool. I just love going to different places seeing new places and meeting all different types of people. Because it do you need to just like get so absorbed in your own small bubble that you forget that there's a huge world out there and there's. All different types of people with all different types of beliefs and it's just really cool to be able to branch out. And see and meet those types of people and see just the. Diversity in the terrain of the earth even in the way that the earth looks in different places is cool. No i have not served in the military. Nope. No i never been formally diagnosed although i would say i probably diagnosed myself with depression just after having studied it a lot in psychology throughout the years i've. Probably ninety-nine percent sure that i've struggled with depression off and on so. Lately it's been pretty easy but throughout the years i've definitely had a lot of issues with insomnia just either not being able to fall asleep. Or just like waking up constantly throughout the night and so right now i'm not really. Experiencing too much of that but. In the past it's definitely been an ongoing issue for me. I'm not a pleasant person one-handed fluval weave is extremely like. Important for me i think maybe more so than a lot of people i'd. I like need good sleep to. Function. I've been feeling really good. Over the past several months i was unemployed. After coming out here and. That was really really tough and i just. Recently got offered my job. Just like last week so i definitely think i've been going through. A lot of crap and just a lot of depression but it's like lifted a lot of has lifted off of me because i don't have that pressure any longer of like. Call megan make ends meet the city's really expensive and i don't have a job and. So i feel i feel as much more relieved than i have been feeling so just good. Yeah well i mean just like i said over the past week or so i've become a lot more. Positive i was kind of like. Feeling a bit like a hermit in a way it's just hard like being in a new city and not really knowing too many people and. Of course like i said not having a job kind of causes you to. Kind of. Just like being your own shall i guess and that was kind of how it was how it's been for me and. Just since i got offered the job i just have. So much more. Confidence in like positivity that. Things are are. Starting to workout from youtube good. Probably a couple of days ago actually i went. I went to explore part of the south bay area that i hadn't really been to before. It is i was just going to go for a jog along the beach. And it was really foggy outside and then the fog started to lift and. It was just beautiful and then i went for a drive up kind of off this like cliff where there's. Beautiful scenery that i never seen before and i just like was overwhelmed how pretty it was and i was just like i can't believe that i get to live here so. That was definitely a happy moment for me. My best friend would probably say that i'm very daring and. Bold and fearless. I'm unique. And artistic. And i don't. I've got that. She probably say that i'm a non-conformist. I don't really think the way that a lot of people do and i question everything which can be a good or bad thing but. Probably. Just like. The fact that i really try to live my life. With. Like no regrets and just i tried to live a very. Exciting life in a way and i think that especially ever since i finished college and have been traveling like i haven't. I've tried moving all different places by myself so i think. Just the fact that i am not really afraid i don't let things hold me back i just if i want something or if i want to do something i just do it and. I guess. In a way like i like that about myself in the fact that i'm really independent and can just go and. Do whatever i feel like doing even if it's hard. I still i'm proud that i've overcome a lot of those struggles. Oh there's like minor things that i regret throughout. My life but there's not anything really major cuz i think. Pretty much everything that i've done i've learned from whether it's good or bad so. I wouldn't really change anything. I would say i would tell myself when i was a kid that i. Should just keep dreaming big and don't let anything that anyone says like stop me from believing that anything's possible because. I guess as i've grown into an adult i've really seen and started to really believe that. Truly anything is possible and then if you really want something you can go after and you can get it and so i would just. Tell myself to never give up and just always believe this. You can do what you want to do. Scentsy. Oh i guess. I went home recently for christmas back to oklahoma and i got to see some of my friends from college that i hadn't seen in like since. I graduated so. Which has been like 4 years ago so. It was really awesome just to go out with them and we went to dinner and we went out afterwards and just had a good night and it was really really fun. Bye. Okay. Taco catering. \n",
      "Alright wonderful. Okay thanks. Yeah. I'm okay. I'm from los angeles. Oh the weather the weather the weather the weather the beach the weather the beach the laid-back nastu. Driving instead of public transportation. S40. I really. I don't know the lack of. I don't know there's not a lot i don't like about olay it's compared to most cities i really. It's my favorite and i've lived around the world i love it i love. A lot. Yes i've lived. Didn't parison i've been around the world a lot. Died it's just dumb it's. Fun and it said that it's a blast it's good to see new places it's good to. Get to. Get to experience all the. Fantasticon sites and and. In cultures. Well i mean. I attended to actually do a lot of them i probably would do them differently i think i'm more developed as a personnel. I lived in paris for two years so and i lived in spain for. Spain was fun spain madrid is a party town and then. And into these are all work they will work so that was working so it was on. Is grinding you didn't really appreciate you know what was around you so much and then. I mean i still. I still love going just to you know vacation spots like hawaii and and to make a i'm still just really. A sucker for that kind of stuff. I guess madagascar was pretty much like just. Really bitching because it was it was in the eighties and. It was like you were seeing a lot of people that have never seen white people before according to the guy driving us around i might he might have been lying. But it was just it was bitching and africa was pretty much the best senegal and madagascar. I'm right now about to go for an early childhood education. Degree and then i did a little bit of paralegal but that was really just too. Just to get the. Just to get the skype and i didn't really have any concept of what i want to do and now i really do. I have i was saying to rachel actually i don't know if you guys are able to overhear i really think that. The way the school system goes right now is it just it it turns people into. Into i'm just. Just chat. Dog-eat-dog you know. But i don't like the way i think it's told draining the school system right now and i feel pretty bad for everybody so. Try to fix that. That would be my dream job that's so i'm excited like i want to go out in a direction that i want to go and yeah that would be my dream job is to work. With sort of getting kids on it more organic. Universal. You know trajectory. I think it could be done i don't think it would be done fire. Any sort of. Legislation sit here and there i mean that always ends up for becoming you know. Facade and forests itself anyway but i think there are ways i've always reached kids anyway and they've always felt where i was coming from and so. I think you know there are ways to sort of buck the system without even talking to this. I guess i'm just a combination of the two i don't think. I don't know actually i'm kind of might even be working that out there might be some outgoingness to overcompensate for was actually shyness and vice versa.. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah that's cool. I definitely. Try to reflect and stay in a pretty lucid space is often as possible so. A lot of lying down at the moment i'm in transition so there's just a lot of and i hang out with my dog's a lot. So that's. Quite soothing my try not to i don't really do anything that's too. 10 cinema 6 time for like time to drive to a job but i'm too. You know go make some things happen meetings and stuff but otherwise. I tried to stay in a pretty relaxed space most of the time so it's not like break and. But you know and i. I meant i miss swimming i can't believe summer is coming so i'm going to swim some more too. When i'm truly outraged it comes out and then i i'm hitting some kind of. That part right next to our time and fighting for my child so. There are times when i will just cuss up a storm just to get off some steam. A little bit but usually pretty much there's always. You know someone. In the periphery that gets it and and you know it's like that bumper sticker if you're not outraged you're not paying attention so. Usually some kind of sanity can prevail. Oh well i mean these are also times where i just can't find something in the car and a bit when i argue with people it's been a lot of the times when i'm being flat-out. You know sabotage drawer definitely. When. What's the last pacific. You know i lost my temper dreadfully with unfortunately. The woman that gave me birth because that she is intrinsic and a lot of i mean she's pretty much horrible person so i've recently. I felt like. I mean i alike again i think i should have said this just now i felt. In a way. Good because. I get it. You know which is as opposed to not getting it which is even worse but i guess there's another side of the bank. The thing to get to to wear. You can be a little more constructive about it it's like. You know you get to a point where you're glad you can actually see that there's a horrible travesty going on but then you have to figure out how to deal with the horrible truth. But so i mean i didn't feel like shame i really honestly didn't feel shame. Didn't i didn't. There are times when i feel like it was stupid to lose my temper just because. There people that will try to use that against you that's all. But i never really feel bad for. Being angry about what i'm angry about. Well when i was pregnant i wish i had. Like i said i went through. Such an awakening about realizing when i was being. Sort of undermined that. That demanding. My respect became a huge issue and. When i was pregnant i ended up being so disrespected in the place cuz i was being a hippie on the beach for six years so. I was it felt like i was being so disrespected in the place where. I was set to be when the child arrived at i stormed out. Via what was a good survival mode before but. Left me jumping out of the frying pan into the fire and they got my kid. It's f***** up. I don't want to erase anything from my memory. Like having everything consolidated and. Cohesive. I don't. And integrated i don't want to erase anything from memory. Well did i get it right or did i get it wrong. Yeah i guess the hardest decision was whether or not to. Sign. Signed mediation agreement with dcfs and i should have said no let's just go straight to court because the. There is nothing wrong with me i just. Happened to succumb to an ssi check via bulshit with my mother's and i should have just. Benzino brave enough to just go in there and do that and instead i chickened out and did their mediation and they played me out. Over consciousness. It's. Horrific horrendous borgia quality. Intrigue and sabotage it's bad. That's okay. Someone that i mean. There's been. You know there's been some. To some great people that again from afar i have not. Sodev. Really. Achieved a real great ability to build relationships and i'm working through that right writing it right now and i think that's a lot why don't i have my son but. As i've grown and developed. Scene encouragement from like-minded souls and you can see that and say that's wonderful and. But otherwise you know a constant you no contact with someone that's really good for me that it has been hard for me to. Get to that point. Not so easy says it all. I'm being i've been i'm not. Completely centered and then there's been some. Actually you know. People thinking it's funny to harass me or jolt me as they walked by and so there's been actual harassment. And stuff like that. I'm still pretty pollyanna doubt i still forge ahead and try to be as pleasant as possible. I'm tired and drained and a little bit frustrated because that i know that. I've been sort of. Did i sort of have a bit of. My energy and end space being usurped and i can tell and i don't know how to get through that and passed it. No. No. There are i'm basically very very very happy pretty much. List out person but. I'm just fighting for my son has me sort of trudging areas that. It's as if the same trees that were thrown in my road in childhood before i realize i was such a happy person. I found her again so i'm going through some of the same pitfalls and mistakes but. You know during the day i'll i'll think something completely true inorganic and i'll just stare at something good wow that's beautiful and i'll be reminded pretty close to my spirit so. I try to stay there 24/7 i'm pretty spiritual that way. I mean if i had one that was willing to say all the nice things about me gets pretty competitive out there. That you know that i'm this is off you guys. That i'm funny and that. And that. I think that's bad i'm done funny and then i'm good and that that i'm trustworthy. Just not necessarily change but grow through my ability to connect with the people i want to connect with. And disconnect from the people that. Manage to. 2. Drain me. I already said i regret the thing with them. Leaving the place where i could have delivered my son even though i was being. Assertive. Ww's. Get the f*** away from your mother. You know and like a lot of. And and. Yeah and open your eyes look what look what's going on. I'm proud of my spirit and my outlook and. My my access to what's really going on in the world and. My awakeness i'm. Proud of. Me as a person. Okay. You're welcome. Okay it's the old thing yeah it's the old tests the other one. Laxative two questions ago. \n",
      "Are there any parameters are i mean is should i just talk. Naturally or just whatever i'm comfortable okay. One last thing. Yes. I'm okay. I'm a little. Pensive i guess a little. Down but. More or less okay. I was born in. Annapolis maryland. On the east coast. Originally i moved because i went to film school. And but then i decided to come move back to washington dc to do some work and now i'm back here again. It's very different being from the east coast it just has a different feel to it. But living. La is very as a very different kind of. Attitude i guess and so it's a little difficult but i. But i've gotten more used to it. Since i've been here. Not at all. When i left things got things are sort of. I lost my job out there and so i had to move out here kind of quick to. To be with. Some people who are going to help me out and i'm just. I don't know if estranged is the right word but i'm. Kind of. Not. Really speaking to my family are old friends that often. It's not easy. It's. It's kind of. I miss i miss a lot of people i miss my old life before i lost my job. I miss. Some friends. I miss a lot of the relationships that i had out there. So it's difficult i mean it weighs on my mind a lot. I feel like i failed and now i'm here and i can't seem to get back on my feet so it's it's. It's hard. Depends on the situation i think i'm outgoing. When. I'm comfortable. And then i'm extremely outgoing but when i'm in a situation i'm not comfortable with i tend to be a lot more shy. So that doesn't really answer your question but. What do you do to relieve. I have certain. I do i do a lot of writing. I have. Certain. Music that i listen to as i'm writing and when i can. When i can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world. The music and the the thoughts just kind of. Happening really. It can sit soothed me it's like it's when i feel most relaxed i guess. A few weeks ago i guess i was i've been working on a on a on a book on a novel and when i was really. But i was really getting into writing it and. It was really working for me that was that was good that was really good i felt like i was accomplishing something and i was felt really relaxed. It was about. Guy who's searching for. Something it's. It's it's his last day on earth and so he's going to find. A person that he. That he. Matt and just. Was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and. Spend the last few minutes he has on earth with her just because. Certified it's sort of romantic. Adventure comedy, thing. Well i'm always i've always been a writer part of the reason i came to la was because of screenwriting. So. I wrote some screenplays and. You know had a little bit of success with that out here and butt. Since since that i kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and i've started to write more short stories and and longer. Just. Creative writing so. I've been meaning to write a novel by just waiting for. The idea that. To really hit me. It's not easy. The parts. The parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle. I find it difficult to have a real love-hate relationship with writing when i when i love it i just absolutely love it but sometimes i. Hate it because it's so difficult. But it's worth it for the times when it's when it's. Good. Good i don't i don't really have a temper. It's not i mean most of my anger that i have is directed inward as opposed to outward other people. If something is really really stressful if i'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation i can. Lose it but i could probably only happen to me 34 times in my whole life i mean generally i pretty much. Try to. It what i'm upset. I get upset with myself not with other people. Last night i guess. I got in an argument about whether or not. Cleaning. Vegetables was necessary because of. I forget but it well no it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because i'd already started cutting the vegetables and i thought that would be okay. So it turned into this. Big argument and we did google searches to figure out who is right and who is wrong and i. I ended up being wrong on that one but it is. Yeah that was it wasn't a blow-up argument but it was a definite argument. Lot. So much. I was in a relationship that i really really. They really wanted to work. And. I ended up and it was partly due to. I hadn't i was on and i wasn't on the right medication and so i was going. Lick everything that sort of spiraled out of. Control and. I feel really guilty about the way that that ended that mean i wasn't. I wasn't mean but i was. But i was getting more and more messed up. And i couldn't stop it and it ended and so i feel really. Guilty about not doing enough and. And not. And you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again. So. That was pretty that was pretty tough. What some of it was was. That. I wasn't. Medicated properly i mean now i've been to a doctor and i'm on medication that's. Completely kind of. I mean i still get. I still get upset and i still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not. I don't. Completely lose it for days at a time. So. I mean i know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if i had. If i had been able to deal. With the chemicals in my brain then i would have done it would have probably been different if i was who i am now then. I would have i would i would be. I would be. He probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but. I mean i could have. I don't know i don't know if i could have done anything different. Things being how they were. I mean it's. It's possible i mean obviously. Yeah because i mean that's what i do i i. Take little i mean i take little things and i just think about them all the time in my head until. Until it drives me crazy i dwell on stuff. And like any little detail that comes up. I suddenly remember any can just throw me off. For a whole day i mean i still. I still get. I still get really uncomfortable and embarrassed and i feel ashamed about stuff that i did in high school. Which was years and years ago at which i shouldn't even be thinking about anymore cuz it's so in the past but i still get. That feeling like i'm right back there. Welts. It's not. Easy i've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it i mean i dealt with it for a long time by. Bye. By drinking and and you know just trying to like. Slow my mind down that way. But you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better. Well like i said i. Do a lot of. You know if i'm if i'm writing or if i'm doing anything like i kind of have to almost. Be doing two things at once. Too occupied. My brain completely if i'm watching tv i have to be playing a game on my phone if i'm using the computer i have to be. You know. Watching a tv show or movie on yuno on in another window so that i can just. Keep. My mind occupied. During all that. I just need i mean i wish that i could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but i just i can't yet. They're triggered by everything. Pretty much anything that i said i see if i if i. If i hear somebody with a dutch last name if i if i hear somebody talk about wisconsin if i hear you know people talk about. Anyting. You know i can reach back and connect. 2. To this it's really it's really. I don't know that's the thing i mean i don't ever get a break. From it. Now. I'm a very light sleeper so i. Awake and asleep and awake and it's i have no problem going back to sleep but i generally. You know don't. I don't know i'd never really needed much sleep. So. It's just only recently that i've really started to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep. Like i would i would usually stay up until 2 or 3 in the morning so that i could just be so exhausted that i would just. Call gout and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work. But now it's it's. It's like if i do that i can't i still don't get enough. Asleep i don't clock out i still just sleep very lightly. You know i get up i toss and turn all night you know and now. It's just. It's. Yeah i don't sleep too great right now. What are you like what. Pretty i mean. I don't know it's hard to it's hard to know i. I usually just kind of power through it and just. I'm at i'm like how i am now i just i just feel. Bad. I think. 334 years ago. It was. When i. I had been given taking stuff for anxiety for. 4. Years before that but then i finally got a psychiatrist. Who actually sat down and talked to me and said. You actually got. This. Situation and we need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working. You need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like. Even you out and heal you a little bit. From all this so. So yeah that was that was kind of a turning point but unfortunately. It happened after everything. Went bad so. How do you feel. At the moment i don't know i don't really think i thought about it too much then but looking back on it i feel. It really makes me. Angry it really makes me you know given where i am right now it makes me really angry that i'm. That i had that i i lost everything because. Because of. Chemicals in my brain because of. Things that i couldn't control. And that. You know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me i mean i was paying as paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing it you know it wasn't. It was it didn't help it didn't work until. Until. You know i managed to find somebody who did work and i just yeah so i'm i'm like thanks guys for. Helping but. It was a little bit little late now. There really wasn't any choice i had to i was i was a mess i was. It was either. I was i was self-medicating it was affecting my work i mean it was everything was just. There was a point where i really realized that i mean i just had to like make this different but again it was too late because you know then my review came up. Much later in. You know after. After everything after being institutionalized once or twice and. And all this stuff you know they just decided that i was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off. But. It was at least. That and not. Firing me. But but but yeah but so i got help but it was. But it wasn't. Soon enough. Not not as much as i should. I go to a couple of. Meetings. I go to i go to aa so that i can. You know keep control of that aspect to it there's a so there's a therapy aspect to that. Unfortunately you know being unemployed. White employment ran out you know i'm dying to know what i'm getting my medication from the city of la so. You know i'm not really in a position to. Put money into seeing. Somebody so i have a psychiatrist that i go see but it's really. Very. I've only seen her three times in the past year so. Basically to keep my medication,. Then there's you. Well like i said i mean. This the top i mean. Let's just take the aaa for example because that's. Probably the close closest. Sing with therapy right now. Just saying stuff out loud is just like. Getting getting the stuff. Out. Trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense. That you can actually deal with. Is a big step like. Regardless of who. You're saying it to whether it's a a therapist or just a room full of of. Drugs you know i mean you're you're taking all that. Stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something that you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can. Talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless. Thing. Yeah. You know better than i that i have been i mean. It is sort of. It has its ups and downs. You know i'm applying for jobs. 56 jobs. Or more a day you know i never getting a response never getting an interview never even getting close to. Due to being self-sufficient again. It's hard but that's like real world problems i feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control so now it's just i have to deal with real life which is. Jazza to juices don't own challenge. It was probably you know a couple years ago. I was. I mean the thing that immediately comes to mind. Is. Everything was going well at my job i was making these great videos with. This person that i ate that i was having a relationship with and we were really close. We are having fun together. And we went out and got. A christmas tree. And. We spent the all this time picking out the perfect christmas tree and it was just. Feeling like. A part of somebody's life. And feeling like. Apart. The bigger. The bigger life. That's that's out there you know like what normal people feel. You know for that instant i felt like. A normal person. Do the normal thing with. Pretty girl who really really like a lot and. You know everything was. Going really well and. I didn't wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant i felt like a normal person a normal happy person. And. Part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that. I don't know if i'll ever feel that again. So. Probably the. Probably this. Educate educational series i did. Educational. Video series i did for this national science foundation. It was. It was really hard and it would but in the end it turned out really good and. You know i'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids. And it helps the world with getting kids excited about. Science in about. And about the world around them so that i feel like that was a real contribution that i made to. The world. He was part of you know it's part of my. My job. It was it was a. We were trying to come up with. With new ideas. For because we were put together videos and stuff to give you no. 22 schools and everything and they've done those before but we decided to do something really big. You know when there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of. And there was a lot to it and so. It was probably the biggest. Project that. The nsf has decided to do and so we just kind of. Produced it. Yeah. I guess. I don't know i don't know it's been awhile it's been awhile since i've since i really thought about that somewhere would i. I don't know. Thank you. Audi. \n",
      "Don't i look gorgeous. Please straighten up a little bit here. Chat with her for a bit. Okay. Yes. Quite well i feel good. Los angeles. California here. One of the few. Native-born los angeles. I. Homeschool my ten-year-old son and. I'm a homemaker i have five children and married 22 years. So that the full-time job. Somewhat we can we went to israel about 2 months ago. For a pilgrimage with a church yeah so i would say yes i've traveled a bit. Well most recently we like 2 months ago we went to israel for pilgrimage we were gone about nine days and. Was fabulous it was we spent the first five days in corozine. Which is near the. Galilee. And in a place called. Name of the area is causing but. We stay in place called the domus galilea which is. A house. For that welcomes. Christian. Pilgrims as well as jewish. Pilgrims. I enjoy like really the most important addresses like meeting the people and and of course seeing the the history especially israel amidst the. Totally ancient butt. Most dangerous is the the the people i think. To get a better understanding of how. Different cultures. Live. No. Not at all. Just don't i. All my life i've always been. Open and and willing to socialize and. I remember my younger brother always. I'm joking saying that i would talk to anybody and i will i'll talk to just about anybody. Just because i enjoy. Learning about other people. Most of the time by the end of the day after a family. I there's a word game on the computer that i like to play for a little while and then. Watch tv have a cocktail with my husband. And just relax that's what we do and you know. Because we have a lot going on we don't stay up too late so. Like to watch crime dramas. Really mad. Probably not a lot. I get frustrated with for example my daughter does not clean up. Her room. Almost ever. So that that gets me angry but. In terms of like really. Getting like. Heatedly angry i mean other than like. Little things that my children do you know. Especially my oldest child is 21. You know he can be confrontational so. Other than that nothing really gets me like really angry. Haven't i have. Haven't felt that. Contributing to society helping. Helping. To raise responsible people i guess. And of course the love and affection in the. The fun and excitement that goes with it and all the stages that go. I mean like really right now i'm in a stage where my children. Are either adults or teenagers i only had i have one eleven year old and the rest are all teenagers and adults. So it's really fun because we're able to talk about current events. All kinds of stuff that's going on in the world and you know how. Have. Challenging discussions and. That sort of thing. So it's this a different level than when you're taking care of babies and. You know changing diapers in that kind of. The hardest thing is that it's 24/7. You never not apparent. You know it's and so you have to accept that and that's i remember when i first. With my first child. Thinking you know when i brought him home from the hospital this is it i mean there's no going back you cannot. Change i mean i guess you could if you did something horrible but. I mean adorable circumstances you can't change that and it's a permanent thing and. It is. In some ways it takes away your freedom but in other ways it gives you a different sort of freedom. Always. I'm sorry. I didn't get what you said. Positive to my life most importantly my church. And my face. But also my husband he's been a really. He's kind of he's very like. Logical thinking and very grounded. So what if i get emotional or i get upset about something he's always. We balance each other out likewise if he gets upset about something i'm able to balance him out so. It's been a that's been a great gift in my life. I don't think i'd be categorized as somebody with a. A temper. Occasionally occasionally i get angry but i don't like have like. Rarely do i have outbursts. I'm more more likely this you know to say what i feel. Not let it build up. So you don't like my husband and i don't. Rarely fight like hell. Arguments that are yelling and screaming or anything like that it almost never happens. Because like i said i'm more of a type of person that communicates on the spot so if i'm thinking something. I usually communicate it right away instead of letting it build up. Usually i'm arguing with my older son because. You know he thinks he knows every. His 21 years old so he has the know-it-all mentality. And i'm just telling him that he doesn't know it all and you know his like was on hillary more. He's very confident and very self. Cell phone with or self-assured and so he thinks it you know everything he does is correct. And. He still has a lot of learning to do. That's all. It is it can be. I think. That many of them are. Boiled and living environment of. Of instant gratification. Which i think is going to be. Detrimental to the to the future. Of this country. But. In a given that with all the technology we have is really not any way to go back so i. I have. Hope. That. They will. I mean i think this country was built on hard work and ethics. And. Hopefully our art the next generation and. The generations after that. Can maintain that. That standard of living i don't know if it's possible. As loving nurturing. Funny. We laugh a lot and. Caring. Honest. Things that. I mean my best i have. Well actually my best friend is. It's two people it's two sisters that i grew up with and. We. I. For some years. Took care of their mother was alzheimer's before my parents got sick so i would had a very close. Have a very close relationship with them still do. And so i'm considered the fourth sister. So i would say that those are my best friends and and. We love each other very much. A good relationship. No. No. Yes. Most. Mostly mine early depression it was more anxiety. Probably. It's probably been five or six years i mean i've had it off and on all my life but it was never diagnosed originally. Like as a teenager i think is when i first had started with anxiety but. Other than that i i you know so depression kind of goes with anxiety if it's not under control. But now it's under control so. I have a great. No i think it was what they call flea flea free-floating anxiety more of a organic. Reason. For it another words that there was a. Chemical imbalance. And my brain. I've been feeling pretty good actually the holidays were great. Good family gatherings little stressed because. We're making a big decision right now to help my parents out my dad is really sick. And we've offered to move in with them they have a big home but we would have to do a lot of. Some renovation and some. To help. Then some obviously moving around. And so we're in the throes of that and. So that's a big big change but i'm looking forward to it because. Really don't want my parents to be alone as they get their in their 80s. So as i get closer to death i want to have my family there with them. Not. Easy usually. All my life i think i've always i mean i've always had. At least i wake up at least once in the middle of the night. Go to the bathroom basically. Other than that i mean no not sleep well i mean other than that i sleep well but sometimes if i wake up like really early in the morning. Then i can't go back to sleep i'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then. Go back to bed and. Go back to sleep depends on what my schedule is and if the kids are. Have to be the school early and there's a lot of factors. I'm done with this. Probably basically the same i think i might complain the b like oh i'm tired or my body hurts or whatever you know. But i think overall i'm probably the same. A kids now i'll be the all-time i get though i'm really tired and they'll understand like my older daughter will be really helpful and. Letting my the daughter will try to cook dinner or something like that so that you know. Then they put you in a little bit more. Not really. Not not no. Not really. Not anything significant. Actually yes i do. I do feel like therapy is useful. Well we had a situation with my daughter. She also suffers from anxiety and. We have had her in therapy for some time and we just recently i were about to finish. A group with her it was a six months. Group for dbt it's called and it's like a. The first time that it's the first time their documenting using it with teenagers. And. It's been really good it's been very helpful it's just all about. How to live in the moment and how do you know the actual physical and mental. Strategies to keep you or keep you from. You're mine from going crazy you know worrying about things or we know. In this case some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever so. That's the focus of the therapy and it's been really good my husband and i both have been going with our daughter. And it's been really. Really informational and really helpful. Oh my daughter was she was. In a bad way she was you know suffering a lot and. We knew it and. We acted on it that's all. Like. Really joyful and happy i would say probably. Probably would be in israel when we renewed our marriage vows in the the ethic in cana. So you know where the wedding of cana took place that was really moving and beautiful. And it was it happened that our anniversary was. We left on our anniversary day we flew to israel on so it was right at the same time was beautiful. Meaningful. And other than that i would say you know like. Other joyful occasions have been you don't like christmas and. You know family gatherings and you know my dad's birthday he turned 83. On christmas eve you know that kind of think so. What's an interesting question i would say. Once i get like. Things done that i need to do like if i'm. Have a lot of a lot of either. Work to do around the house or. Answer one once i get them done. I feel like a sense of accomplishment. You know much like. I mean i worked for many years as an administrative manager at ucla and. You don't want to get a project done or you get your whatever. Muffin stuff done or there's a lot of different things that. Ethnic deadlines result that feeling of like yeah i got it done you know. So i think that would be enough for me the most. Most recent. Way of. Feeling good and feeling you know. Like feeling accomplished. Dream job. I think i've already lived it i'm also a birth doula. And. Yeah and. Private ended a lot of birth and now i really only do it for family and friends. And it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in is. The birth of bringing new life into this world so. I would say that's probably was my was a dream job and i didn't know it. I trained much after you know i did my managerial stuff and. With all it is and was awesome so i don't work at a hospital anymore. Actually the hospital that i worked at is now closed. But. Like i said before family in french. I attended a friend of mine's birth by accident she up she happen to have the same ob as i did with all my children. And i came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor we were freaking out close friends. And. You know her labor picked up quite a bit when i got there she wanted me to say she didn't want me to leave. I hadn't planned on it so that was the first birthday attended outside of. A myself giving birth. Which is a whole different experience. So after that it was really interesting interested in possibly setting nurse-midwifery. But then i discovered this thing called being a doula which is really gives you. Even a lot more hands-on one-on-one contact with the patient which is what i like. So i trying to do that at a hospital in inglewood about. 15 years ago with my son is 15 and he was a year old mill 16 years ago. So. Yeah. And i've been. Well it can be challenging in terms of hours it depends on how long the woman is in labor but. And you know also like. For me i always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their dual that i cannot guarantee 100% i'm not doing it for business. And that way and because of that i don't have like backup doulas that in case i'm sick or i'm not available. Somebody else could fill in for me. So but so far it's been that all the women that have asked me i've been able to be there for some reason still there. The the only one that i missed was one a friend of mine from church who wanted me to go with her second baby i was with her for her first but her later went so fast he didn't even call me in the middle of the night and she was like. 2 hours of labor she would even if it called me i would have been there in time. So i went really fast but other than that. You know. Yeah i've been has been able to attend all the births of people that have asked me to do. In-law love life or in your job. Probably might my own birth. I mean the birth of my own children. Like there's an extreme. Sense of joy excitement release. Because of course you're out of the pain. And then like. It's just it's just a matter of you know going forward from there but it's. It's like something you can explain it's just it's awesome. After you give birth. Song. And i've experienced both ways i've done both. Natural end. At my last job losses by a c-section so i've had both. Both experiences. Light with my fairchild had kind of a crazy nurse she was a little. Psychotic but other than that we laugh about it now but when i was in labor it wasn't funny. And she. She was not there when the doctor let me know it was my third child was. Born very quickly after he broke the water and wolf. My husband was there but she was not in there was a doctor and she got in a lot of trouble. Because i only had like two contractions after that. My daughter was born in the bed. So for me it was great cuz i didn't have to go through any other labor but. I'm sure they weren't happy that to fill out a lot of paperwork after that. So. Now what i get myself for 10 or 20 years ago. 10 or 20 years ago is probably more. Noticed. Relaxed not as. Like i feel now my age that. I don't have the same concerns that i did then it's i don't worry about. I don't worry at all about what people think about me i don't worry at all about what. You know. Get out like why i noticed my daughter so mom you can't wear that because people are going to say this is a don't care. You know but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that oh mom you have to dress like this or just like that or whatever. So that will probably be at the wisdom that you you achieve with aids that. You see how life there's so many things that are more important life and worrying about little things. Most proud of. Probably my family like my husband and my. My children i mean the fact that we've stayed married that we've. One intact family that. My kids see everyday how. Their friends suffer who who come from divorced families. Single parents and. They. They actually express. Gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still you know. We are still a family. So i would say that's probably. Probably the. One of my best qualities is. Being able to listen to people and being able to. Not be judgemental. Through the years i've had a. A lot of experience with. People with problems lot of friends with problems people i know from church and. It's just taught me that. Everybody has weaknesses everybody has problems. And. I don't think i'm better than someone else. If you think you're better than someone else and that's usually to me a sign that. You don't know yourself well enough. Okay. Okay. Goodbye.

I just think the familiarity of home just makes me feel comfortable there. Smog. Rudeness, doesn't compare to new york it's. People could be unbearable in there rude. Not as much as i'd like lately i traveled more in the past but not lately no. I just think things different places. Learning new things funny things that are fascinating that piqued my interest. See. I think spoken new yorker i think the first time i went to new york i was quite amazed i know it says still only in america but i just think i'm being from la i didn't think anything or a city could be bigger. And more how do you say ostentatious the new york but. It was it was quite an experience and i didn't think any place was. I didn't i didn't think any place was dirtier than downtown la i think time-to-time squares goddess beat. Too many to mention ike i don't even know where to start. Depends on the situation. What are you doing. Like to walk i like to i like to play with my dogs. Reading. Anything where i guess i suppose i could just sit still and let my mind go blank i know reading require some concentration but. Noticed things that i don't have to exert myself too much helps me relax. In the past i've had problems but i'm getting better. I probably are good my roommate couple days ago but that happens we're friends loving argument if you will. How do you know. I'm at this roommate about 67 years ago we just kind of. Can you ground the same social circles and just got a loan. It's cool i mean. It's a hino like we do argue we have our differences sometimes but there's not one person i'd rather have i rather live with then then hershey school. How much time do we have. It's just too numerous to mention. My i would know how to answer that. I think breaking up with a girlfriend that i truly. Cared about but knowing. Going bad just wasn't going to work. That was very difficult. Just weigh pros and cons and just thought. I just wasn't going to work. No matter how much love. Or care i brought the relationship. There was something missing. And i think i messed enough time. She invested enough time and. Just knew it was over. No. So many. Regrets by things you erased from your memory. A lot too numerous to mention i don't know how to answer that. The same girl that i broke up with shoes she was a girlfriend. Best friend of mine are they were separated for 4. Several years. And we always had a chemistry always a friendship and it turned into something. Something which you don't turn into a relationship and it hurt him currently we do not speak i will shut my regret is i wish i. I would have handled that better. Tell me about your relationship. It's itsfunneh soon as i get older i'm not as close but i still care for him and i still love them and i think they love me i. My mother and my father both alive don't interact a lot and very close to my older sister. My older sister. She's just. Strong no-nonsense.

I was diagnosed probably about. But five years ago. I think. Always knew there was a problem. I always knew there was some. Hi i think i always knew before i got treatment that. There was some issue emotionally and. Other things are very hard to explain. I just was tired of feeling that way so i thought help. Think just. Lethargy. No desire to do anything motivation just wasn't there. Thedonald depression type things. So should i become socially awkward which was a little bit different for me because growing up i was quite talkative. I do. I'm sorry figure. Got you it does i think it does. Well. I think the number one thing this is what i'm amazed about september i think i've it's allowed me to. To step back from certain situations. Not take them so seriously. Not get so tense or angry. And then react. I think it's headed call me down for the most part. Now it's becoming it's becoming routine. Initially it was very difficult. 5 years old.

Power that was daughter. Oh was just crying when she left so to be able to give her give them back that was del school. I think for somebody that.

Yeah it was best car sometimes planes mostly w just i guess i'll say mostly down south but it was. Really fun. Especially the road trips. Just a general and also drama. My dream job is. To become a real estate investor. Welive. Sort of really been into it every since 2005 i just don't have the capital right now or the connections but. Since i do like real estate i'm just going to start off as a real estate agent. So i should have my license sometime this year. Outgoing. Well i'm not sure why it could be a little bit of both but i'm pretty outgoing. Well speaking of hawaii i did live there for a year-and-a-half but what do i do to relax is either i'm usually take a nap. Take a bath. Or just try to get things off of my mind and try to spend my energy and more positive ways. It needs to be worked on but i know when to control it. When i need to. Well me and my ex-husband still get into arguments is this. Just over a text message but. Actually it was my fault but usually it's his but it just starts little and kind of snowballs out of control but. That's usually how it goes. Well i. Don't know what else to do except for pray on it because i thought once. I moved into another house it would be over but i see that we're still getting into it. So i don't know maybe ignore it or if he wants to be right then let him be right i guess. Probably quite a few things but i don't regret anything i've done in my life but. Situation i wish i would have handled differently just. Kind of everything in my life almost i could have done it differently or i would if i had the chance but i'm not worried about it cuz i don't regret anything that i've done in my life. The hardest decision probably when i had to get a divorce. That. That may have been the hardest of one of the hardest decisions. It was just. A lot of. A lot of stuff through the years the relationship is kind of deteriorated. Another relationship. Between us. Was still good. Then the things that you were doing. I would have been able to overlook it a little bit more because i would feel like well our relationship is good and. It's difficult to find a really really good relationship but since our relationship deteriorated and there's just a lot of disagreement and arguing and. Problems financial problems and he's doing this so. I just decided just forget it i mean i tried but. You know he didn't want to corroborate so. Well i'm happy with what's going on now i mean i wish that we could still be a family but since that's not going to happen yes i am happy with my life right now yes. Something i can erase. I don't think i really need to erase. Anything. I finally gotten over the way the kids treated me at school but other than that i can't think of anything to erase. It's fair / good there is no problems right now so i guess i'll just say good yeah there's no problems. Well i would have to say my mother. Yes. Unless she's just always supported me and everything that i've done whether it's. Good or not so good so i think that's a blessing. Sometime sometime it's not. I just don't get enough hours of sleep i guess that's what it is is i would like to sometimes. So that's. More the problem. I would like to get. I'm just sleepy sleepy tired feeling like i want to go take a nap. I've been feeling fine. I know there's been about the same. No. No. I'm really happy probably last week because i got over to a little bit of money so. Well i guess my best friend will be my mom or maybe my entertainment friend that i've been annoying since 96. I really wouldn't i'm not going to say i don't consider him a best friend that we don't really hang out that much but he is very ungenerous to me and my mom. So. Well right now i spend my weekends doing chores and classwork and sleeping in. But maybe after the classwork is out of the way maybe i could do something else. Myself well i do wish that. At times i could control my temper a little more and course i would like to lose weight. Be a little bit more active. And i wished my skin would clear up. It was probably when i was in school school years or terrible for a lot of people because the kids are animals. So they try to make you feel like you're nothing like your piece of turf onto their foot so that's probably the last time is an adult now. I would say that i'm genuine i'm honest i'm supportive. And i'm just to get friend. No. Well. 20 years ago. Just because you're pregnant that doesn't mean that you're eating for two and you can eat loads of food like people tell you. That's the main thing i'm going to tell my daughter's no. I'm just eat as you normally eat but eat more healthier there's no need to gain 80 lb when. The baby is just 20 pounds or less and you have all the sweets lose. Also if i came into any money now 20 years ago i was probably just thinking about shopping or. Just kind of spending it on frivolous stuff where is now i would invest it. So yeah i think that's about it. Proud of. I guess maybe myself. My kids. Hey thank you. Bye. \n",
      "Okay. Okay. Yes. Fine thank you. I'm originally from india. Yeah. I'm sorry. Why do i miss. Sorry. Why do i miss la. About 20 years ago. Once every 3-4 years. I mean the first 6 months it was a little difficult but then i got used to it and then i'm feel i feel very comfortable now. Yes. Seafood. Actually i enjoyed your. Flying. Then you don't meeting different people. Different scenes. You know then. I tried try to achieve my goals. I'm sorry. I used to run a business i used to travel to. Meet people to get orders. And that traveling involved i'm going to northeast. Albina ohio and pennsylvania. A place like that. Meetup people. I have to get my to get orders for my business. And you know why i enjoyed. Listening to that problem so user take them out for dinner. Handog baby.. I really enjoyed genuinely enjoyed talking to talking to them. And many of them we're open enough to tell me about their problems. And. Oh you do. Main goal main main objective was to get the orders for the business. You don't cook. Watch movies. Meet friends. Ultra party. I'm talking to you. I'm an engineer i did mechanical engineering. I'm altering nba. Actually i bradshaw to finance i trade stocks now. A friend of mine was you know making a lot of money in stocks and you know. I was um. First i used to you know we interact with him will also be. With him when he was trading stocks. And i realized he was making a lot of money then i did a formal course in it. Attended lot of seminars then yeah. Lost lot of money. And before i started making money. So it's the same thing that i said. You know watchmovies.go. Does it people. Play basketball. Then do shopping cooking. I'm very good at that you know. Even when i'm irritated and i'm very good at controlling my temper. The last time i argue with. Was with my brother. It was about my dad peanut but you was getting old i mean he's getting old and. He lives in india. And i was planning on bringing in here my dad's and my brother said it's going to be pretty expensive to. You know pete's going to be very expensive with respect to. Health bills. And if i was you know arguing with him that we should all pull in the money and get them here because they are quite old i have a mom to you know they're both old. I'm very close to my parents not so closed. With my brother. And their family. It's deep i mean like. I tend to be judgmental and i think sometimes that the my niece and nephew should have been.. Got up in a different way. And you know. And. You know my my brother doesn't seem to. Thang long. The same lines and. You know the we have disagreements and you know that's the reason. It is. No not at this time. What do i think of wife. Can you can you repeat that one more time. Can i still couldn't follow you. Okay. No. No. Oh yes. But wanted two years ago. I was feeling down and i was not interested in things that i that i was normally interested in. And you know i was sort of withdrawn and. Babe it was i was not able to focus on my things so. I thought maybe i should go see a doctor and i ended up doing that. I know. I mean i lost appetite i was not sleeping well and. I had difficulty concentrating you know and. Focusing and. I was not getting my assignments done on time these were some of the problems. I've been feeling good. But. No i don't. I started doing yoga and you know about doing that for about a year and. That's and meditation. And that's a lot. So it's just that you know when i was diagnosed with depression i thought i should be taking any medication for it. And i was looking at it other ways to get over the problem and then i. Realized some of my friends we're doing meditation and. Oh you know i ain't got into inspire them. It's a little difficult. But hopefully i'll be able to sleep within half an hour. There are days when it takes almost 12 hours to go to sleep. Are they what can you repeat that. Oh no. I just been open. Just switch off the light and. Beetle keep tossing around and. Try to focus on things that makes me feel good. And this math. But three days ago. What am i proud of. How i wasn't i was among the top 2% in my mba class and. And when i used to run my business i designed up how to. That was working really well. And i was happy that i was able to design something that was so useful for my business. My. I'm thinking my friends would describe me as very friendly. Three easy to get along with. Very focused. Very intelligent. And good cook. Albert einstein. Summer summer summer food stories. You know. Obviously didn't it involves lot of deep thinking and are the the first few times i read about him about is. Curious. I had difficulty in really understanding that. And that it'll be. I mean wednesday. When there when there are things that i really try to understand and i am not able to. And you know. There are there are the type of people i admire. Listen to other people. Its diverse and i like the the entertainment industry. And i. I like a. The other fact that there are more of them in that men here. There are certain areas where wendy's. Where wendy spanish is spoken you know i would like. For all people who come to america to be able to understand english and be able to speak in english. So that everybody can participate. In la. I mean like i. Some of the things the political leaders do really makes me mad. Sometimes i think they're wishing they wishing their time or time and other countries are advancing. Hand. You know these guys don't get things done and. Pedo i feel very bad about it and sometimes it makes me angry. Yeah. I mean the first four years of. Obama administration i think it was wasted because. Ifd. If congress. Had acted together. I got things done then you know. Maybe we could have made it much more difficult for china to catch up with us. And you know the fact that china's able to do things and get things done much faster. And these people still you know argue and. You know follow up. Find fault with each other and not get things done. Humpy. they don't seem to realize that. You know the clock. Keep sticking you know they have to get things done. I mean like you know well. One thing that comes to my mind is well you know i'm a lot of money while we know once in los angeles. And. You know i thought it happened during christmas some 10 years ago. And that's that made me very happy. Good music good food. I mean the. A party with friends that i like. And. And. You know i also like cooking and i enjoy cooking with groups. In groups. Those are things that really put me in a good mood. I'm sorry clean. I listen to people. And i empathize. Titus holiday problems. And i'm hoping they think i'm it up. My advisors and recommendations are. Worth their time. Thank you so much for being nice. Bye. \n",
      "Weather. Thank you. Yeah. I'm fine. Pacific grove california. The wholesale. Opportunities and all the stores and. Anything i could ever ask for. The traffic is the mood of the people in there. The unhealthy pace. I would see i did like culinary and i did really good in art and music. And high school. Through my own will and desire to want to. I get involved. But the music. No. Open up a health practice of some sort. Changing things in my life that had an impact on. Myself and others for the for the benefit of health. When i have the opportunity. Buying things seeing the culture. Relaxing not thinking about the city. Well yeah i used to go to texas every every year with my dad during the summer. And i always wanted to stay there and live there when i went on vacation. Most likely one of these trips to texas where we would go and spend time in the desert shoot guns and ride go-karts and stuff like that. It was. Seawall. My dad and i are. Are not really talking that much and my mom desta weigh about 2 months ago. Thanks. Definitely marsh i always been that way. I just a personality that i. Grown into but. Learning how to adjust the sensitivity and grow out of it. What are you doing. Tean. Eating i like to eat i make that calms me down. Not that good when i get really upset that it's usually a problem and i have to. Work to calm myself down and sometimes i just. Don't. Get on something and i don't stop. Sometimes. But i've learned to control it. To that extent now. Yesterday i was arguing about what's what kind of water we should be drinking. Oh well difference of opinion and i felt as though my opinion was very valid. Even though the other parties opinion was. Somewhat. Misinformed. Definitely everyday is growing process i wish i would have handled everything differently. Everyday which is what. Makes me grow and i. Try to work towards how i would have wanted to handle things everyday. Little by little. Can't think of anyone right now. Find i'd i'd say not. Supporting my. Friends as much with their. Career choices. I'd rather not get into it. The raw food educators on youtube and robbie can educators and the detox there. Therapy. Experts. Have been really inspirational in the past 2 months. Well that they believe that. The essence of all nutrition comes from the raw fruits and vegetables and. This is true with many studies like. T colin campbell the china study. These sources of information that are that are very good and. I think deserve respect based on. You know real are you search. Really easy. Almost got it down to a science. I'm tired. And feeling. Better than i have in a long time. Oh yeah i think it's due to the transition the diet and. In no way having a placebo effect that's actually you know. Loosening out toxins and things that i've accumulated over. My short lifetime. Mom. You know toxic choices with food and. Drugs whatever it would be. Yes unless tense and less irritable and i have more clarity and. More control over my. Decisions in my wants versus what i need. That sort of thing. Nope. Yes to some extent. Over 5 years ago. Lack of motivation and. Basically make my symptoms were. Paralleling that of depression. Loss of. Appetite loss motivation not wanting to do anything. Not wanting to be social at all having fear. Social situations. The main. 45. No. I believe i overcome to chapter in my life that was the the doctor. You know they can control my health and. Experimenting with drugs and i just sort of took another route which was alternative and i started. Juicing more and just trying to listen to. Maybe what i needed with help of. The internet at nutrition experts and stuff like that. Yes. I believe therapy is useful because. Without looking inward or having somebody to help you do that. It's very hard to readjust to some of these problems that you can have that. We'll just resonate in the subconscious and tell you now it has an outburst as basically. Therapy. Will help an overall health and mental. I believe. For everybody. Last night. I made a really great vegan. Dinner with no meat tacos and cheese and guacamole. Had a couple of my friends over and they really liked it a lot i almost converted them. I would say. You know i'm trying to listen to. My inner conscious more than. What my brain wants me to do. Like my brain likes caffeine and sugar. Or as you know my body needs something other than that. Apple. It's very very hard. That's. A daily process. I was. Handling money for a business partnering. They ended up short and i was to blame but it was actually my. Formulas of. Crunching the numbers that it made it short but they he was unaware of the change i make the formula so. The blame is on me that i may have took money in it i automatically felt bad about that because of my. Uneasy my uncertainty to the change of formula. No. 20 years ago i was 2 years old 10 years ago as 12 years old i would tell myself to. To start eating. Raw fruits and vegetables everyday. As calm and. Sad maybe smart talented. I really enjoyed going to the wholesale food market in downtown los angeles. Lots of food. Great prices you can. Eat and feed a whole family for a third of the price is going to a normal supermarket. So i really get a lot of enjoyment at teaching people. How to maybe better themselves especially food-wise what they're eating. Eating and watching a really good tv show. I'm insightful i cannot. I can adjust to people. I don't know i guess i'll skip that question for now. I'm most proud of. That's in my overall situation with where i'm at right now i could have never imagined that. I'd be in such a fortunate. Situation. I think she's done. \n",
      "Baby girl. Yes. Okay. New york. To pursue music industry a job in the music industry. Oh yes. I'm self-employed. To become a music producer. It's pretty hard as a lot of competition. To pursue a job. Owain. About a year ago last february. It was pretty difficult east coast is a lot different than the west coast. I think i've been there twice in the past year. More creature of habit. Yes. Sometimes i feel like i don't fit into the crowd so it's better to sometimes to be more quiet and. View everything instead of a. Are going in and actively pursue things. Probably. Listen to music. Spend time with my dogs. Probably. People being in. Not very very nice to me or. See in justices or. I think that's about it. Pretty good. Probably a couple days ago one of my friends was saying that. They were making a comment about how i am and i got kind of upset about that. Yeah does. Pretty close. My best friend so i. I just one of my friends. I kind of am quiet about it and when person pushes me to certain point that's when i overreact usually. It's pretty hard i rather the person notice that i'm kind of getting withdrawn and actively engaging me instead of getting it to the point where it's like a proportion. Probably spending time with my family. A new york. Very close. My sister and my brother. They're just great people. And i love them a lot and. They're a lot like me so i feel like i have people that understand me. Probably. Castle oil. Sensitive. I don't know it's kind of hard to hard question. No. No. Yes. Gosh probably. 1997 so a long time ago. I'm just. During that time i was just going through a lot of issues and. I was feeling unsafe to myself so i ended up going. The doctor. Can you get meds and have therapy and stuff. Not currently ended about like 6 months ago. I'm expelled the therapist wasn't really. Helping me i thought we kept on talking about the same things over and over and. She wasn't challenging me and i've been in therapy for a really long time so i just knew it was a change. Yes i do actually. When i feel connected to a therapist i feel like it's a really great way for me to talk about what i'm going through. Yes. I do. I'm better at describing my emotions and feelings i think the biggest thing is. When i'm in situations i can see myself reacting one way and i take a step back and see how it can react normally almost in a way. Also i tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and kind of bury them and make them feel really bad about myself so it's nice to talk to someone that's not judging that doesn't really tell me like you know. They told me it's okay basically. Feeling hopeless all the time. Not having you know enough energy to do things i used to like i had a little bit of concentration issues. Having weird disturbing thoughts sometimes just pop into my mind. And just overall just feeling kind of crummy about life. Sometimes they are like random moments if there's like a problem with like my interpersonal life or something like that or if i sometimes even seeing something on television. Like sometimes that affects me. Listening to music or. Trying to distract myself trying like my therapist told me for the longest time to journal to record things. It's been a tough transition to come here so. Being here so kind of half-and-half okay and not okay. I feel like i've been a little bit with more withdrawn. Lately. But that's about it. Some days is great some days is not. More recently it's been a little bit more difficult. I don't know why i have like a lot of thoughts on my mind at night so i tend not to sleep. For a while and i wake up. Quite frequently during the night. Very groggy in the morning and. That's about it like during the day i tend to yawn a lot. And my friends always are like why are yawning so much are you disinterestedly what we're doing and i'm trying to tell them it's not that at all. Play christmas time. When i was with my family. Just really happy and. Feeling everything is alright in my life. Have a good sense of lake where i was at the moment. Being present with myself. Probably. You know. I see it's a hard question. I think probably. I can tend to read people kind of wall sometimes and. I like to say i'm good at. Link being good friend to people being a good family member. My hard worker when i do have a job so. Sure i mean that's life so of course there's regrets. One that comes to mind is. I wish that i don't eat as much so it can be a lot more healthy. Don't take things so seriously. Enjoy being useful. I think that's it. Ask a question probably my previous job in my employment i worked really well with kids. So i did a great job at that i was. A researcher. I'm at a hospital and i helped a lot of kids out. For about 6 years so seven years. Yeah who's awesome. I was really kind of like. Reading people and so i decide to major in psychology. So then i went and worked in the a.m.. Mental health facility and did research with them. With less drugs and depression and things like that so. Have found a good niche for me. No problem. Goodbye. Hi. \n",
      "Okay. Which is whatsapp recording your body okay. When you're finished when she's done. Okay. Thank you. How you doing today. Okay how about yourself. Where you from. Here in california. Well that is big and bras a lot to do a lot of. I'm job opportunities than other states. Pretty much that is big and it's a lot you can do here. Traffic. Maybe. The violence write the bad news even though you don't even want to know what's going on in your environment but you still have to watch it so you can you do look out to see what's going on on a daily basis. Sociology i have a. 2-year degree in liberal arts but my major was sociology. No i'm actually mta bus operator. What's your dream job. Well says metro is study growing. My dream job is to. Move up. And accompany. And i'm about to actually start some classes for supervisory next week. So cuz they look to promote within the company. So that's a good thing it's a lot of opportunities that metro where you can take classes in their pay for your. Tuition and things of that nature. Thanks. Well it's not actually hard as right now is easy if you take advantage of it right now cuz they look to promote within so you know since i'm already working there. That's a good thing. So is good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that you're interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder soon as possible. What do you mean i'm sorry. Okay. What do you do. Free take a long walk. Hot bath. Meditate. Just close my eyes sometimes. I'm pretty much good because see by me being a bus operator you run into circumstances and situations you got to remain calm and still remain professional at the same time. How hard is it. Well i look at it like it. It goes with a army comes with experience you know. You do something on a continuous basis usually you some somewhere down the line you become good at it you know so i. I look at it like that so i've been driving for years. And dealing with the public sources how you. Handle circumstances you know you treat people like you want to be treated. I'm pretty good at it now. Maybe when i were younger you know. You as you get older you get wiser you learn different things and i'm still learning today. I will say my family you know my kids you know. Even though you don't have been having a lot of deaths around me but that's just that's part of the. Life experience you know you born here but you got to leave here one day. But. My kids will keep me you don't. Saying and you don't love them in my family. Thank you. No. Set good examples you know because. Unifirst teacher. You know. And you want to set a positive good example for your kids. And i think that's a good thing and it starts at home. Well by you being the first teacher. Your kids you're the you're the one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up. So whatever's been taught in the home they looking and learning everyday you know rather is that homeschool you don't kids have a tendency to do things with a c you know what i mean so you try to keep it positive good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and you know different things of that nature. I have a. 4 1/2 year old son i have a seven-year-old daughter and i also have a twenty-three-year-old. Yeah i'm about to be. Well my daughter's pregnant with the boys she has three little girls so have three grand. Kids and on one on the way which is the boy this time. Yeah thank you. The hardest thing is. For right now. I'm a single parent so that makes it hard alone itself you know. And. They can be expensive at times you know. And depends on the person. Situation you know whether they have help or job. You know things of that nature to help the situation better. But. It's hard you know but. You i try to eat. Keep a job you know keep food in the house you know just maintain and support my kids the best way i can. With my kids or just.. What's memorable for me is that i'm the only one in my family with a degree. So it's kind of like yeah it's kind of even though i'm the baby of 10 kids you know and. I always kept in the back of my mind even though everybody will pretty much my whole family have decent job but i'm the one with the degree so i kind of like gave myself a pat on the back like you know. You know that's the only thing i remember and graduating you know and my family there to support me. Thank you. Happy that i accomplished something you know just. Even though i may not be much but it was better than just having a high school diploma and i had i was working on my bachelor's degree but. I ended up in a bad car accident i never went back i got distracted and you know i was working at the same time but i was just like more so i needed income then. Then i'm schooling at that time because i was a young parent you know cuz i have my daughter 17 so i was like i needed the money to support her but i never went back but i feel like it's never too late. So. I feel like i take some classes matter i'm with metro. To help me move up the ladder so that's why i'm starting my class next week. Thank you. Well device i would have gave myself. But i probably would have been a young mother at a young age. And that. I probably wouldn't. Stayed in school you know not let the accident just. Distract me a knot. I would have remained in school i probably would have had kids early. You know. Whether i'll probably would have stayed in school and probably have a part-time job or something just. I just feel like. Education is. An excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learning different things keep your mind open to learning new ideas everyday. So i think that's a plus you know and anybody shoes this the better they sells you know through education maybe two maybe promote within your company or whatever the case maybe they help. Better your career. I'm quite sure. You learn from your mistakes you know you but the same time you don't continue to make the same one i feel like it's okay to make a mistake but long as you do something. Change you know like myself even though i'm going to school late but still. I'm going you know i want to better myself career-wise. Yes. When was the last time. My oldest daughter. We had an argument because. Just. The life she's living right now and the things that she's going through. And. I had told her that she just needs to make some changes to better her situation. And i'll we got into argument because you know how your kids sometimes don't want to hear it. You know. Here's the stuff that you're saying even though. Is true or. Or they just so you know quote they just don't want to hear it you know they may be going through something they don't want to hear but we got into argument about it but. That just happened you know. I just told her my i'm sorry. Very close. Larry closet just that. Build the situation my daughter's in right now she just needs to make some changes to better her her life. And i've been. She kind of like stubborn our own way you know i was raised to listen to your mom you know your mom is not going to tell you nothing wrong. And. I've been telling her over the years you know different things and it's kind of like i was talking to a wall because she did the opposite. And now she's she regretting it you know cuz she like my mom told me this you know why am i doing the opposite so i guess you got a bump her head a couple of times to get it it's kind of like i didn't told you i left it alone and now it's up to you to make the change. How hard is that. It's very frustrating because it's like i'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me. And i'm like it seems like it's taking forever for the change but it's left up to the individual when they're ready you know what i mean one supposed to get tired of something that make a change it may not be when you wanted to have him but. The ball is in her court you know. Only can do so much. Oh wow. Have my days. Since i have two little ones my kind of like trying to go to bed at 8 because you know they got to go to school and i think it's important have a good night's rest because. It kind of like. It it kind of like guess you're ready for the next day or you know how you going to feel if you rested what type of person going to be that day you know cuz everybody has their days you know really good or bad but that's just part of life. And i feel like if you had a good night good good night rest. Hopefully you have a good day you know. You feel that way often. Pretty much. You know i need my rest because i'm out there driving a bus and dealing with all these people and you know. The job itself is very stressful so i feel like if i'm rested it and help me. What am i like irritated tired. Lazy. You know. Feel like i want to lay down probably go to sleep. What do you do when you're annoyed. Never thought about that. What does you know. Cuz like i said you know everybody had a moment to do. Never thought about that. No. No. I don't really have a best friend but. Person that i deal with that i used to work with.

      "Sure. Good i guess. New orleans louisiana. A 2005. I used to go back often but not much anymore. Just things happened. Well. Guess you're not programmed with this knowledge but katrina happened in 2005. Wow. Not. Really. Where to begin. I just always different culturally. Have a different culture out here. It's just a different place. It's spiked friendly. Louisiana is in. New orleans for that matter really isn't. Now they're trying to be but it just it isn't that successful. The drivers the crazy. Really kind of but not much anymore. Don't have the money kind of broke. Just being able to go on an adventure. I once went to comic-con on a on a bicycle like a 3-wheel bike. That was pretty fun. Kind of scary and dangerous. Newegg. Killed scary. Traveling or just in general. I got to say. I got to say we were. We were heading out of. We were. Adding off the pch and going into. Laguna. I'm going to have this really steep hill and on sundays it's full of traffic. And i remember. Going down. That the hill. And my brakes weren't working and i was trying to hit my rice and try and hit my brakes and they just they wouldn't click. And i was like oh god. And i'm on 30 bikes on larger than most bikes. Animal exhibiting in between like gridlock traffic. Going downhill. Unable to break. And i'm going down. And suddenly. There's a car that veers right into. A century where i'm trying to go so. Turn. Sharply. In front of. Between the boss and his truck. And literally end up going sideways. Through traffic through oncoming traffic. Looping back through oncoming traffic. Back into the right traffic still without any breaks. Unlike not managing to keep my bike from. Rolling. Which is painful when your bike rolls. Kind of hurts. What. So yeah. Noted. Various different things anthropology visual effects. Kind of weird but yeah. I've always had a fascination with film. And. I think the white people. Do things and go about things as fascinating. Just as like that the mob mentality of people. Especially. Holt ring job. Huh. I have no idea. Did the job i guess. I consider myself more outgoing. You know. I've never been afraid of what people think of me. Why people don't like people i don't know. I'm not. I'm not afraid of what they think. I'm more concerned with like the people i know and what they think of me. I guess. So being outgoing just doesn't really. Affect me. I play videogames listen to music. Yeah. Read books i like reading books and drawing. Reading books drawing playing video games. I forget anyting sleeping. I like sleeping. Not good. And high school ai shove somebody's head through a locker. Yeah. Yeah that that's not good. Don't. Ever shut someone's head into a locker. That's a great way to get suspended. I don't know. Things like that just. Getting into fights. Like a serious argument. I guess like. Argument over. Over. I guess over like a like. Viewpoints on like that control. And gun control laws. I mean. I was like. Yesterday evening. It was. It was an argument about you do gun control regulation i mean it doesn't really. Affect me personally. But that was like the last argument i got into. Kind of what you specified i think. My entire life. I have. About. 2 years ago i broke up. With. Like. As everyone calls her my evil acts. And. Yeah it was just. It was bad. The whole the whole thing went down bad i mean. I think i've calmed down a lot since then. Which is a person as a whole. But i mean i was. Angry and stuff. I think i like. Want riding my bike for like. Hundreds plus miles and a singular day. And i was in a ton of pain. Like. Later in the evening i got home i was like oh god. I can barely walk. And yeah i think running off and. Like going on like extreme cycling spray was not good but is better than like. Eating too much you know like. Just. Overeating cuz i was depressed. But yeah like we. We fought and screamed and it was it was not good like i physically fight. It was more like a screaming match of death. I've had a singular hard decision. I've heard ever. Had to make. Because. My my biggest thing. Ny. Is. Don't. You know don't regret. Don't regret. The things you do. Just regret the opportunities you've missed and that's like had to come with me. That's like hats i've had to like warned that in the past like 2 years. 2 years ago i totally just cannot grasp that concept. And answer your question. I think thinking about it. The hardest decision i've had to make. Is. I'd say. Probably. Probably a breakup with my ex. Probably. Why do i begin. My ex was not a good person. Just in any way shape or form of the word. She did some things they wasn't entirely comfortable with. Just took that the people around her and to me. And. I. You know. They say you're supposed to give. Forgive people. For making mistakes. Or doing things. And i just i think there's some things you can't forgive people for. No matter how hard you try. And i think there's some things but wants. Don. But they can't be. Undone. Dhhs. They're they're the way that they are. And i think. I think after what. She did. I like i just did. Things just fell apart after that it just. Despite us trying. I just didn't work out. I mean. I don't know i don't really want to talk about exactly what happened. Oggi's. Oh man. Erase from my memory or just erased from ever happening. Huh. I don't. You know that's hard. Katrina. Just the experience of katrina for starters. My axe. I guess between those two it's it's going to her.. I'd actually rather lean towards katrina. Cuz that was just stop. That was not. I mean i guess you don't exactly know about it but. In 2005. This giant. Storm hit. New orleans louisiana. Kill the whole bunch of people. Wobbled the town. And i'm also at a friend's during the storm. I mean i'm kind of. I'm getting over it. But. It's still. Sit still there. And i think. I don't know. I mean. You can try and look at you can try your best to try and find something positive. Not but there's just there's nothing we'd only. Thing. You can do. Is. Just think that was like a freak accident will never happen again. I live in la and you know. Earthquakes. It happened i just think rather. Rather know that it's coming then not know it's coming. Yes. Yeah. Depression it's record multiple times. That's no surprise. First time i was diagnosed was in middle school. Which would have been. 10. Well 10th between 10-12 years ago. I don't know. I don't know whenever i was in the sixth grade that's. My first. Once. Told i was depressed. As far as ptsd goes. Post-katrina. And then. Can own. Post-katrina most.. That was the big thing. I guess having been diagnosed. Previously is being depressed and. Still being in high school. It kind of wasn't i wasn't really. Seeking help at. Kind of. I got a kind of got into my high school. And then we're like. Here's help cuz we know you're going to need it. And i was like oh well thanks i didn't really ask for it but okay i'll take it. You know. Just kind of happened. No not. Not anymore. What's a good question. Cheese you know really don't know. I guess it just kind of stopped just kind of was like. I'm not going to do this anymore. Sometimes. Sometimes it's. A lot of like how are you feeling today. And stuff and. You know. It's kind of well i'm feeling fine right now but. Ask me in 2 hours and who knows. You know. I guess. It's helped me understand that some of the things that just happened just happen. And it just get on and move along with your wife. Essentially just. Mike carrion you know. Things will happen carry-on. Wow. I was. I was. Hanging out with my girlfriend just. Hanging out. Well for starters i mean. You can't. See when i walked in but i'm walking with a cane. Right now cuz i got hit by car recently. And make my life better. What's a cancer over there. That way. But. Anyway. I don't know. Make myself less fat. I make it so i don't feel the incessant need to sleep 14 hours a day. Ohm kiss when you sleeve like more than 10 hours a day it's just. Some productive you waste too much time. Okay friends were like. Oh you know i feel rejuvenated after 6 hours and i'm like how do you do that. I have to sleep with 12 hours to feel good. But you can sleep six you know. Like in in an crunch time you know you can get away with for i have to get away with. 7. R8. You know. My. That's my crunch-time sleep schedule 8 hours that's just. I don't know. I oversleep but i like sleeping too. Just the oversleeping part i don't like so much. Utterly insane in a good way. Utterly insane in a good way. I guess. It would also. So like you know. But there are times where i might seem like an a****** and i'm not really an a****** i just. You know. I just have issues like everybody else. Specifically i have. Asperger's so that's a form of autism. I'm not just kind of makes life. Awesome. Did also say i'm flamboyant and eccentric. Cuz i totally am. I just. I don't know. I figure i'm still alive. So i should live. Because i'm still alive. You know. Who knows how long i'm going to be alive for. So should you know. Live while i'm alive and just. Go out and do stuff not. That's it. And be calm. Except when i'm reading. I like reading. Stop f****** up know it's kind of messed up. I think. I would have. Told myself at the time. Because i have known. My my evil acts. I've known her since like i was like 6 and she was five. I think 10 years ago i would have grabbed myself by the shoulders. And say you see that girl. Whatever you do do not date that girl. Don't trust her she can't be trusted. And more importantly. Don't. Don't let your guard down around her cuz. Show. Show exploit that. I don't mean like physically let your guard down.. Mantua. Yeah don't date or just don't do it. Not worth it it's not worth the trouble it's not worth the pain. Not worth it. The fact that i'm still alive. Maybe. Yeah. I don't know cycling the comic-con i was pretty proud of that pretty proud that i managed to do it. Just. I don't you know i don't really know i don't really use the term pride. I really feel fried. I'm just. It's more like the fact that i'm still alive i'm proud to be alive. I don't know if it makes me humble or just insane. Who knows. Do i press the button now i'll buy. Okay. Tehuti dududududu. By the way her eyes are really creepy. Assignment. They paid. They have the uncanny. \n",

I like talking to people enjoy other people. Go to the movies or turn on music dance. Pretty good. Was that work. Couple about a month ago about a month ago. I got. Mad at someone because i didn't think they were they were giving me clear instructions. And so. When i try to have a conversation about it they got mad and then i got mad and. We got mad. I felt like i wasn't being heard or listened to and. I feel like we weren't able to have a real dialogue so. Because we couldn't have a dialogue i felt like. No one was listening to me. No regrets. I yes. I don't know if there is one i mean i'm sure there is but. One time i was driving behind someone and. They will they cut me off. And. I think it's just been one of those days this was like a year ago or two years ago. Those days where i just didn't want. I just been a frustrating day in this person cut me off and i almost got an accident with them i just. Follow the mother parking spot. And. Actually i'd haunted them and they they flipped me off. And so just really really gotten my skin coming off and almost caused an accident and then. And then flip me off. So i followed them to the spa and i asked. Send miss why did you flip me off when you cut me off. And and she said oh you know i'm. I've had a rough day i don't need your attitude into her. it was with her and i told her well you're not releasing a very good example for your daughter and you know i didn't need to be petty like that but i just. I wanted to be i guess. Get you going deep. Oh it's the hardest decision was coming out to my mom. Song i was gay. I mean it wasn't hard cuz it was the right one but it was hard to do because my mom is very conservative. Mushy. She had trouble accepting it and it it took awhile but when she did you know everything is better and i knew it would be. But it was just hard in the moment 2. Can i tell her something she don't want to hear. When i was little kid my. My grandfather found our dog. Run over in there on the road. And here. And brought it in and i demur as a kid just. Like seeing death like that really just. Threw me off and. Frighten me and. It was from those moments that i guess i wish i hadn't been there for because my grandmother was destroyed she was just so sad. And. Slogomans. I guess you need as a kid but i didn't really want to experience like lost like that in your face. Our relationship allure family is pretty good. We've got as close as most but we. You know we always. We don't talk often but we talked with love and we. We love each other when we see each other. My grandmother was very positive she was always very encouraging and told me. To university my dreams and. That's what little things get me down so glad i had her. Usually it's easy sometimes it's not. Webbing between jobs recently i start a new job next week. But. Well i've been off i haven't been working. I tend to like. My body wants to stay up later and later and later and i'm trying not to like. Fall into the pattern of going to sleep at like 2 or 3 and getting up at like 11. So i keep trying to make myself go to sleep by like midnight or 12:30 and i just end up laying in bed for like an hour or an hour and a half. They should be. I should i should be able to just go to sleep and get up at like 9 but. I want to stay up i guess. A little scatterbrained like today i'm a little scatterbrained cuz. I tried to go to sleep early again and i ended up tossing and turning and. So. Scatterbrained. Most of them had a lot of time on my hands like i don't usually have this much time on my hands so. Sometimes it can be frustrating because. You don't know what to do with it when you're not working i guess. But. Yeah. I think alexis question. I just thought maybe i'm a little more absent-minded than usual just lately with the the not working thing. No. A couple days ago when i got my new job when i got hired. Outgoing listening. Attentive. Fun. Loyal. Bank. Help. I wish that i. We should have looked better i wish i had more hair. Appear losing a little bit. If i wish i was a little skinnier this.

There's like band-aids on your back at sally's mean things and then she just walked away she didn't like help me take them off. Remember like i couldn't get almost trying to find them and then. Remember like putting my head in my locker and like. I didn't want anyone to see me cry so i just like omad in my locker. A microtel like i was looking at stuff my backpack but really i was going to. The crank back who can get the mean stickers off his back. Anyting. Probably. Yeah. You know. I would i would try to keep. I would let myself know to. Twitter think positively and not like we would have people think about you and then i spent too much time as like adolescents. Worrying what people thought of me. And as i got older i didn't care as much and i started enjoying life a lot more so. I went to coachella it's a music festival it was 3 days with. All of my friends and my boyfriend and we. We danced and me went swimming and we barbecued and we laughed and had a great time. Hello. I guess my. My career humble as it maybe i really stuck in la a long time. When it was.

How easy is it for you to get a good night sleep. It's been hard lately it's been probably hard for the last. Going on a year. Depends on my thought process at time i liked it i've been looking for work quite a bit. Soldiers. Wondering why you know i don't get called i i just have i have racing thoughts. So. Are you depressed you know cuz i are worried about things that you know that really i have no control over. So. Late i just been sleeping too much. Please for me because i'm so used to just sleeping. Four to five hours a night to announce change about 8 to 9 hours. I'm still tired. Do you feel that way often. Ugly i have them for about the last few months. What are you like when you don't sleep well. Tired. You know. I don't think about you know that i just do all back on the same things that have been bothering me so. I'm more of a guy and i love the work. And if i'm not too much time for me to spend in my own head. And so. Anel. Either i don't care if i'm busy i'm doing what i need to know. And whatever job i do like kind you don't get into it i enjoy it. Something new for me. And. So i can think about you know. Either work or i can go home and then think about this you know i don't have to worry about. No money. Your bill is getting paid and i can just. Concentrate on other things either you know. Do anything that i like or. Maybe spending a little more time with my girlfriend or you know so that. How do you cook with them. How do you cope with them. How do i cover them. I just. Try not to think about it it's not about what are coping with it or not. I just do live. I'm horrible guy at just. You know i may take me a moment to. 2. Salem cooking something but you know it is if i have no control over it. There's nothing that i can really do about the only thing i can do is continue to do what i'm doing. That's actually looking for work. Actually going out on. Interviews. Talking with others about work so i can just kind of and i'll get back to. Back-to-basics you know i just don't like a lot of stuff bother me it does bother me but i try not to. To let it continue bothering me. Yes. That got me a job gotten you in trouble. If what has got me in trouble. My mood choice i mean. Yeah money i mean my pass i got a past history so. Which. Cartoons to. I'll bother my. My hiring process i don't know them when i get hired so i got to do it. Different different type of employers who are. Felony friendly and. Hot stuff like that and i try you know i was out taking classes on now. How to interview how to. How to answer some of the questions which you know, quite a bit. And. I got to reflect back on that but i just. I got to keep. Putting my head that's not who. Why want to be anymore so or you know i've done. I've done now. I've done my time so to say but i think the timing of the last time i just took a lot of time and. And try to work on. The issues that were bothering me so. You know towards positive stuff i got my ged two different things to a lot of classes. Thought about going to school looking going to school. And. Anything that would come. Change my old ways and and. And try to move on to more productive. Activities. That. People been deceitful. Can you repeat that one more time. Why we talk about later. Have you been diagnosed with depression. I've been diagnosed with bipolar. How hard is that. Stop if you don't you know. I don't medicate so i mean i have been on medication before the past but. I guess i try to live online i try to live life on life's terms. And i just. I know the medical establishment always want to label something in. And what i don't like about it is that they just experiment with pills and i've been on probably every magical filled it there is. For that and. You know. Tell mom that been too strong or something that's coming up and. Please try to cope with things. My life skills you know i i don't i don't want to be using. Probably i know certain drugs work for life. Three to four months six months. Anago did you want here i'm going to try you on this and or i'm going to try on that and it's just. An ongoing process tonight probably for about the last two years. Ask about 3 years i can, just so you know that's it. And. What is different than weather if i would be on meds for it. I don't think so unless it's still the same stuff i still get the same problems and i still. Get the same anxiety that's if i if i was on medication for it or not so. I just. And i'll deal with it you know sometimes it's not good and i get irritated at people a lot i don't like people. I don't like crowds i don't. Like i'm not just people. Even a quiet song. But i got a pretty nice not that personality but i think people can see me and just say don't mess with this guy or. And all. Michelle you know i. Bigi i ride public transportation quite a bit and. Now you just get a lot of loud i'm not just people on there sometimes i got to get off the bus. That's how i'll deal with it if i didn't deal with it that way. Boys that go. I'd rather take the time on. Get off the bus wait for the next bus and hopefully it's not that bad. I understand. Before you found out. Did i have probably 4 i got out. Did you think you had a problem before you found out. Well. I don't know if i knew that i had a problem before i found out the thing is that i know other people. I have a lot of the same town so i know a lot in my younger days. People with y'all may not when i told him that i was diagnosed with bipolar that. A lot of remorse for like all that's what you know that's what was wrong with me we wish you that you would have found that out years ago. And like i said i don't think the meds really work but what i do. I think. Time, i just getting older. Kind of a. Makes it work. What's the weather like. How to say therapist effect of you. How is david ervice affected you. I talk to a therapist. Probably on a weekly basis for a while. Recently. And i'll just to get out my anger. My thoughts. A lot of people. Bugmenot understand. A therapist is. I think the biggest thing is that i can just get it all off. Whatever is bothering it would be. People in ohio. Other issues you don't work or whatever the case maybe it's the same talking about it and they're such good listeners income like. Now that i get myself or whatever that i would give to others. But it's always helpful to hear from somebody else somebody who. Obey has a. What are they go to school. Facebook event. Why don't go anymore so. I kind of miss it you know like i said. Miss mulatto. I just want to let you know i just deal with it you know. According to you know if i ever get a chance to go to therapy again i probably feel. Why did you stop. All monitor reasons and. And all. I don't have. Health insurance there's a lot of things that you know. I like to do but i can't now. Call money situation is not that great right now.. I'm sorry. How does my friends describe me. They would probably describe me as. Energetic outgoing person. I want to get to know people. Laugh i know why i laugh a lot. But. It would probably tell you that i'm also very serious and and. Hidden person i don't. Reveal. I want. Positive influence in your life. Someone who has been a positive influence in my life. Yeah. Songs. I'll probably my boss one of my bosses when i first trailer with a. What exotic animals he was real. Now he was. German and. Vanagon. Chicho nobody saw me but. He talked a lot about. Port on exotic animals and. Show a lot of confidence in man which also build confidence in myself. And. Sort of let me know that you know this is nothing that i really can accomplish if i put my mind to it. Okay i think i've asked everything i need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. I think so. We just have a quick postcode for you. \n",

      "Virtual human. Okay. Doorbell again you can ring that one thank you. Yes. I'm okay. Hey los angeles. There's a lot of things to do i love the beach. I love that i love that it's sunny all the time. And the amount of people. That's really about it behind of people. Just a little. I just like going to new places and just discovering. You things. I recently went to new york. I was there for about 3 months. And it was extremely boring i went to western new york. And it was extremely a snowy and. I don't live in position where i didn't have a car so i didn't get to go very many places and i was in a small town. So i. Aya. It was beautiful for what i got to see but really. It wasn't really much to it. Yeah. Both i'm both an introvert and an extrovert. I really enjoy doing things for myself. I am i have a lot of my own up my likes and dislikes and i spend a lot of time alone even though i do have a lot of friends. Ana when i do go out i do tend to meet a lot of people. But i also enjoy being by myself a lot. Probably outgoing creative. Talented. Fun trustworthy. I studied language. And physics. And. Math. No i'm not. I'm actually. I'm on driving actress. I was something that i fell into when i was a teenager. And i really enjoyed doing it i hadn't done it for years. So i figured why not i just came back to california to might as well try something that i did enjoy really doing. So far i just got picked up by an agent. So i haven't really done anything yet as an adult. But. I'm hoping. Hoping something it'll be fruitful. I really don't haven't had too many. I guess my sister she's done really well. My boyfriend he's a. He's a very positive human being. But. Really i haven't had too many positive influences. I'm close i mean what we hang out i don't tell them everything. They're kind of judgmental. But. Other than that i mean i mean we hang out and i see them everyday. Cheese. It's kind of hard for me to relax, try to watch tv. And i read. A lot. Tell me about it i read i do love sleeping i'm a little depressed so. Yeah it's kind of like i said it's really hard for me to relax. It isn't. I tend to think a lot. I'm about things that stress me out. Imma been through a lot of a lot of stuff so i. Yes i i don't i don't i don't sleep very well tonight and if i do fall asleep i wake up. Other than i usually with some kind of anxiety attacks. I dream a lot about the stuff that has a. Halifax of me throughout the years. So. Usually unical dream about something that stressed me out and then i'll wake up and make my chest will hurt. Or just. I just can't sleep all night because i just think. I seem to be i don't know if i'm afraid to go to sleep. But i. I just i don't know i feel like that. the vulnerable place for me. Because the stuff that have happened to me. So i'm. So i sleeping is just not really something i do well. Tired. I'm a. A moody a very sensitive. Yeah i'm just not a negative person. Which really that's not me. Yeah i'm judgmental is not me either. I just. I'm just not a not a nice person to be around. I tried i spent a lot of my time reading i try to go out and do i force myself to go out and do things. Just to keep myself involved so that i don't just sit around and dwell on the fact that i can't sleep and i try to get myself is exhausted as i possibly can. By running around in and doing things. It's difficult. I'm i do like there is a part of me that doesn't want to. I don't really want to go out and do things. I have to actually force myself to if i have make appointments i. I make appointments to like for auditions or. Leaving to do this. I am potential. Does not. Like at the last minute i'll try to convince myself not to go but then i force myself to you anyways. Yes. I've been diagnosed for two instances. I was diagnosed about three years three and a half years ago. And then i was diagnosed again in august. The first time it was. I just wasn't because of the not sleeping. Aaliyah. Justice of the unbelievable stress. And then the second time it was once again i start with the not sleeping. I'm and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me. And i just like i just couldn't take it anymore. So i figured. I was getting too gloomy as getting i come. Not thinking life was worth it and i. I just needed to see somebody before anyting escalated. Yeah. It was. And i do not. One of the reasons i went to new york was to try to. Get out of my environment. And. And that seemed to help a lot. And i'm out here i i was. I just the counters that i was going to just didn't really seem to be helping me much. I'm they just. The descendants be giving me a lot of medication and i don't believe that that's what i needed. Yasso. Stress. Lately i've been really sad and i don't know why. But like i said i've been trying to combat that by. Keeping myself busy. Actually. I'm kind of. A couple days ago. I was actually really happen it was genuinely happy. But then i went back to. Bang you going back to feeling miserable. I realized. I got up in the morning actually did get a good night's sleep. And. I realized that i'm actually really lucky. Cuz i've been through a lot in my life and. I have a. Somebody my life who really loves me. And somebody who is finally there for me. Anda. You know gives me. What i need emotionally and i was just really thankful for by. And that made me really happy. Thank you. Oggi's. I've had so many years of jess. Just bad just a lot of bad. That there has been a long time. Since i've been proud of anything. I guess if anything it's my. Ability to survive. Through all the hardships i've been through. A lesser person i guess would have. Got rid of themselves a long time ago. But even though like i'm really depressed and i feel gloomy and i just feel miserable bottle out of things. There's got to be a silver lining. So. So yeah so me and like i guess that's what i'm proud of that. Although whole bunch of bad things happen to me it hasn't ruined me i still try to be a good person i try not to be negative towards other people. And. And truthful and i still i still have drive-in me. Huh. So much. Last marriage. I'm not getting out when i should have. Panda just. Are going a lot. The any situation that would have had a red flag. Just get out of it you know some things just don't work. And i'm. No matter how hard you try no matter how much you put into it. So awesome. I i would tell myself to. It's not selfish. To let go of a bad situation. And i'm not everybody can be helped. So sometimes you just got to live for yourself and help yourself. Had i known that then had i known that. Then i i probably would have done better in life. People who. When people are down on me for my faults. That i have done that i have things that i've done in my past. The people steal still relive when i'm trying to forgive myself. People who are mean to other people. People who talk poorly about people behind their backs. People that are untrustworthy. Just anybody who pick some a little guy. Meaning of people who don't care about the environment or animals. I just i think that everybody should be as good as they possibly can be. And it's disheartening and it just makes me so mad that. People just can't be people don't let people live. People try to make. Everybody feel is negative in his par lea seydoux. And i like that makes me mad. Event. Yeah i tend event. And then. And then and then it's usually over i try not to bad-mouth people. I try to just talk through it until until it's gone and then it doesn't bother me anymore. I try not to get angry. Time. Because i have a really bad temper. And it. And i can get out of hand. So. What i do is i i have something gets me so mad i tend to go and take a nap. I'm not in that situation where i can just go and take a nap i usually just walk away from the situation and i try to clear my mind. And come back to it. It was a couple days ago it was actually my mother. It was about. Actually she thought that i had taken a shirt from her. And she was screaming and yelling at me. And. I was i was tired on my was it was late and. I started to yell back at her unit because i was hurt that she would accuse me of something so petty. Any. It's a going back to my past you know when i was younger and you know i didn't care about you know people's things and i would just kind of take and do whatever i wanted to and i'm not so far from that person. And it hurt me so i got mad and i and i started to yell and argue. Kind of petty and stupid but. At the time it seemed. Same.. Viable. Hi most memorable experiences. I've had so many. Maybe. It was. I don't know. It was. Probably. Graduating pharmacy school. I felt pretty great i didn't know if i was doing. Very very well or not and i ended up getting like on my last test scores i get end up getting like 98%. Andi'm. I'd actually i did had no confidence that i had done it well it and class in school at all and i i didn't even know i was getting the gray those getting so that was a really big accomplishment for me. And yeah that was great it was a great memory. Unreliable. I am. I'm talented. I. I'm a good listener. I'm always there to help people. I tend to always try to do the right thing. Sometimes actually forget that i have any good qualities but. I'm just. I am. Alright i try to be you knows is good in the best person that i can't reach other people and myself. Gwen, shows. Just them. Having moments where you just laugh with people. Sometime just rating puts me in a good mood. Sunroom. Pie that's not it. Thank you. \n",
      "Okay. Yes. I'm good. Michigan. 2 years ago. Every 3 months. It's more homey and country than fast facing. I work in the entertainment business so i had to be out here. It was pretty easy because i lived in new york first and if you can survive new york you can survive la. The weather of course beaches. People are much router in me than what i'm used to but i like away. A graphic design media arts. In high school i was ahead and all my classes and credit so i had to take the college course. So while in high school i got a 2-year college degree. Doing it cuz i was good at it. Yeah but now i want to go into something else. I'm in school actually i take online classes now for business management. I am. Really one day i want to own me and my sisters went on our own rental properties in. Backup. Real estate company we own fix houses now we bought with our college money. And not we would eventually one day own her own homes and apartment complexes. Yeah. Meeting new people seeing different things that you've never seen before. Different languages everything to seeing what the world has to offer. Okay me and my sisters went to hawaii last year. Am i believe we went to honolulu and took. Tamale. And we met the people in hawaii and they were so nice if i can live there i would. Everything was memorable but probably jet skiing. In honolulu is very fun. Outgoing. Music. Music is. Much baby for me. Well my family is very musically inclined like my dad and my mom's family so. Music has always been like that thing no matter how i feel about her music on. It makes it much better. I'm pretty good i used to box so it let out a lot of frustration so sometimes i do that too i go into the gym and i do like a kickboxing class but i don't i never escalated to the point where i like. Blurred holder now i can control it pretty much. Why living my sisters are argue everyday but it was over close my sisters and clothes always close. My mother and my father are pastors of a church. I grew up with. Two sisters and older brother who was the cop. But pretty close i have a nephew. We're pretty close like. Every day we see each other close and we don't all live in the same house but we're together every single day at some point. We living at when we lived in michigan my family isn't michigan. What i cheat like right now i'm on a diet with my sisters but last night i snuck got mcdonald's. I feel bad because they've been so sticking to it and i cheated. But that's pretty good. Me and mike with me and my friend of mine got into it. We said things that weren't like we hit below the belt that we and we usually don't we haven't spoken in like 3 months now. And i know that it could have been prevented if. We would just sit down and talk to each other but it didn't make it that far. So. Probably moving here. Moving to la. Because. Like i'm i'm really like. What we really post our family like i skype with my mom and dad everyday. So it was hard to go from there to here and then taking care of everything to me and my sister passed and do it on our own. It was much simpler different. Oh my goodness. I'm parents my brother. My dad my mom my sisters my family have a great family so my family definitely. 2 years ago 3 years ago. My brother was shot on duty. And he almost lost his life but he didn't. And for some reason. As much as i try i don't tell them this cuz i don't want them to be like i need to. You know whatever but. I always think about it over and over again and i'll cry about it like it happened yesterday but it happened three years ago just the mere fact of almost losing him. Panda. Not easy. I work as a. Personal assistant and administrative assistant for casting agent. So i'm on call for her whenever so i'm never i never get a good night sleep ever. Enough. A zombie i'm pretty much. You would never know. When is work. Unprofessional soul i am tired they never know. But i'm very annoyed and very grouchy when i haven't slept. Tired. I have crazy headaches but that's probably from not getting enough sleep and working too much. But yeah. Very tired. Here. Definitely. I'm shorter with people like. Being in the industry i mean people don't really care it's all about self. When i first came here i had the i had the personality and attitude of family and love and nice. And being here show me that everybody's kind of out for self here. Even the other girls i work with. I've learned to like cut people often be short with people when that's not really me but i just see that's how you have to be. Last saturday. I did a way in and i lost 7 lb i was like. Cited. Care too much. I think about others more than myself so she probably say. I care too much i'm loving. I'm the person that every friend i have some fight in from best friends and just regular friends. So yeah i'm the mom of my friends. No i don't regret anything. Never take no for an answer. I wish i could. Well i don't know. Personally i want to lose like 20 more pounds but. I don't know. little more. Adventurous. Little more adventurous. I don't think i've. Habitat. Baby feel better now. I can't. No i don't think i have one. I'm sorry i don't think i have. My sister has just started with yoga and. We already do the beach like every friday but. Yoga is like our new addiction so we do yoga. And you probably go to like a spy or something. My job. My career because i've. Gotten a pretty long way at 23 the job i hold so i'm pretty. Pretty proud of that. You're welcome. Bye. \n",
      "Trigger job on that. Alright. Okay ko. Sure. I'm doing fine. I'm from columbia south carolina. Yep. 2004. Once a year for christmas break. A lot slower paced. More. I wanted to. To pursue a film degree or i'm sorry a film career. Yes. It's pretty challenging but it's fun. I've always had an interest in film and movies so it seemed like a natural fit for me. Took about a couple of years. But i. I feel like i'm pretty used to it now. I liked it doesn't snow it's warm weather. And there's lots to do with a lot of beaches. Show the traffic. And the cost of living is pretty high. I've never been outside of the us but i would love to at some point. Depends on the situation i can either be introverted or extroverted just given the right circumstance. I like listening to music doing crossword puzzles. Reading and hanging out with friends on weekends. Very good. I don't think it was an argument maybe that difference of opinion so is more like a debate. But it was pretty pretty tame. I think it was a. Debate over sports. I'm a basketball game. And. I was talking on facebook with somebody about it. But i think it's good too. Express yourself if you have a difference of opinion it's. It's natural to you know. Not always agree on things. So. I think talking about it is healthy. I have a very good relationship with my family i get along with all of my family members and extended your cousins and aunts and uncles. So. There's no one that i have ever had any risks with. With my family. I probably could have been more discipline growing up. And. More. More disciplined with schoolwork and homework that kind of thing. But for the most part i had a had a good childhood and there's not much i would change about it. Probably leaving my comfort zone in south carolina moving out here that was pretty. Hard but at the same time it was. Exciting. So it was it was a bittersweet feeling. A lot of excitement mixed with some anxiety but it's. It went away pretty quickly. Sure. Not doing better in school when i was in high school. I definitely i could have been more diligent worker i could have applied myself a little bit better. I've always had a strong family support system. And our parents and siblings. So. That's definitely a positive thing. Event. Probably going back to school i wish i would have. Wish i would have done better in school so i could take something back from my past it would be. Scholastically related. It's pretty easy. I don't sleep well. I tend to be. Kind of lackadaisical and. Just tired throughout the day kind of groggy. I know everything's pretty much the way it usually is with me. I'm feeling pretty good. I know i have not. I know i haven't. First time i felt really happy. I made a lot of money a few weeks ago and i feel like i'm ahead of the game with you know what having rent under control and a lot of bills out here so. I'm still kind of have the lingering effects from that happiness. When i. When i have money i tend to be a lot. More even-tempered not even tempered but i tend to feel better about things. And we're optimistic. And the city being such a about your finances at it always makes you feel good to be ahead of the game. And to have. Dish have sources of income. I think i'm creative. And i think i'm a good listener. To be as discipline and focus as possible. Because once you're out of your. Parents homes and out of their lives you have to. Depend on yourself in the better. The better you do in school in the better you are. As far as discipline concern the more pleasurable pleasurable your life will be in. A lot. Your life will be a lot easier. Let's see here. I wish i was more. Discipline. But i'm working on that and i've gotten a lot better. At that. It's become pretty easy i think i'm just getting older mom out of my twenties now so. Definitely seen a change from when i first came out here. Some people tend to say that my decision to move out here was not feasible and kind of a pipe dream so that kind of made me feel bad but. I kind of take insults and stride and sometimes are welcome. Constructive criticism. Something is wrong with either you're not aware of so as long as it's not mean-spirited it's coming from the right place. I think it could be an invaluable tool you listening to what other people have to say that might be negative. Probably optimistic and. Outgoing optimistic and. Helpful. My ideal weekend. I would love to go to vegas and have a road trip with what three or four friends. In a packed in the car and just. Lots of disposable income. And you know good weather. I haven't been to vegas and probably five years but. I've gone to casinos with my brother that's pretty fun sometimes. I'm proud that i've come a long way from when i first moved out here i'm a lot more disciplined. I read a lot. I do crosswords. I think i've. I think i know what's important in life now and i'm more focused and going after what i want. I'm not a big fan of high taxes. But it doesn't really make me mad it makes me frustrated and and. I guess i taken in stride though. I had a friend over at my apartment and i watched a movie and it was fun. It was a documentary. Best sports. Sure. Goodbye. Alrighty. Cool. \n",
      "Equipment. Alright. Push this down. Lexi. Sure. Okay i guess. Not bad not good. Sosa. Denver colorado. Pursue job opportunities. About 2 years ago. Once or twice a year. I really like the sunshine. All the opportunities all the different kinds of people lots of stuff to do. That sort of thing. I hate the traffic. I wish the seasons were more distinct. And everything cost a lot of money here. Pretty easy. People are rude. Not having enough money. Just a lot of things are frustrating i guess. I guess it depends on. What i'm annoyed about like said another person or about something i did or just life in general. If somebody like a person annoys me i'll probably let them know they're annoying me. Until they stop. That what you're talkin about. So so not not as good as i'd like to be. A few days ago about getting paid for something i did on time. Pre pissed off. Taken advantage of. I like to go to the gym. Hang out with friends read. Bright. Sort of thing. At times. Because. Sometimes i like to keep to myself and don't feel like. Shannon what about word emotion. I have a degree in in liberal arts major in political science. No. I work in sales. 209. Several of my own businesses and and have lots of money coming in from different streams. Guess that's a job. I used to live in mexico city that was pretty memorable. How much is pretty different than anything i've ever experienced a lot of fun supposed to lot of new things and new people. Pretty young carefree good times. Not recently but i have in my life traveled quite a bit. What's a. I went to london has lot of fun pretty cool city. Well too expensive but definitely cool. Of what does anything in life. What's the question. Moving tellabs pretty memorable took me a lot of hard work to move here so that was. I'm go outside. Maybe like. 6 months ago. Things are just going really well. Didn't have much stress in my life. Yeah i'm. Easier more easily irritated. And. Yell more tired more. Kind of down feeling down more. Not as productive. Yeah while ago. Don't exactly it's been a few years. But i still feel the same as i did when they diagnosed me so i assume i. Still depressed. Well i just saw a big believer in talking to people about your problems so i just thought. That would. Be a good idea so i did and that's what i found out. Oh yeah definitely. I mean it depends on what you mean by therapy like i or most people probably can't afford therapy but just even talking to friends of considered therapy somebody will listen helps you get stuff off your chest. Thanks. Well i haven't necessarily seen a therapist per se but. When you talk to somebody who listens and you and you get stuff. Like out there like out of your head or whatever that it helps to de-stress i think. Pretty girls. I'm a good leader i'm really smart. Being able to. Survive on my own in a city like this completely on my own with no outside help. Yeah lots of stuff. Just dumb mistakes i made when i was younger that. Looking back now with what i know now i probably would not have made. I would tell myself to seek out and listen to people. Older than me as much as possible. He's always good for a. Sort of pep talk but with a dose of reality doesn't sugarcoat anything so talking to him always helps give me perspective. Talented. And. I don't know good at stuff and get it a lot of stuff people seem to notice that i i guess nice could this position funny. Simulator. Alright. Are you like controlling a person in the back or today. \n",
      "Thank you. Yes. I'm doing really good. I'm from granada hills california to the san fernando valley part of los angeles. I love the weather i like the diversity in people i like how you can go to a neighborhood and it's not just one racer. Kind of food i love the beaches. All the activities you could go do lien parks. Aquarium suffolk. museums. This smog. There's a lot of creepy guys. I've pretty much traveled around la i've been cross-country and back three times twice with. When i was 17. I like meeting new people and trying different foods and seeing how other people live. When i was seventeen i ran away with my boyfriend to upstate new york to watertown it was a. Lego navy army kind of town. We had an apartment there are itsnota lie. We sold antiques for a living. Getting calluses pressed houses for the sunset strip music festival through friend. And getting to meet rock stars and hang out i like the private parties. I'm very outgoing i love people. Am i go to the gym and work out quite a bit i find it helps relieve stress and keeps my energy level going i've noticed if i don't work out a couple days i feel a little more tired than normal and. It just helps me feel good. I'm pretty good at it i'm very, i worked a lot of events and. Jobs where you're dealing with like thousands of people a day and people you need to talk to you and you have to remain calm and you know they're the customer so you have to make them feel wanted and good and realize that you're getting paid cuz the money they're spending so. I'm good at resume resolving like consumer complex and stuff on the job. I had a drunk friend that was just. Falling around and yelling and saying rude things to people and i kind of. Started getting loud like just telling her to stop doing that and that she was embarrassing and what she was saying to people was very mean you know. And i wonder like if you're talking to people like that. They might not like it and they could attack you or something you know you never know it is la. I really don't feel guilty about anyting decisions i've made in my life i. Think i made really good decisions and i always stick with my moral compass what i'm doing i grew up in chart so. I've been gone in years but i still have those values and. You know the rules the ten commandments and stuff in my head. I had a slumlord landlord in. I wish that i called you know the proper authorities and follow through on a court case instead of letting him like kind of bully me out because it wasn't up to code. Of years back i was dating a guy and he wanted me to move back. To where he was firm and after a few months you know he was criminally and going back home i decided to move there and i had just started. You know this business is doing event planning with picking up and i decided to leave there. And try to do it there and you know on the east coast and it didn't work out but it was tough deciding like should i leave la and make this. Jumping trade something new and experienced something new or stay and what i was doing. I was i had a degree in dental assisting i did that for like a year i didn't like it and then i was sending communications. The gradient television broadcasting in journalism. I'm someone i'm doing a van work and i wrote for a magazine a couple years and i'm trying to like get a website going and then have like where i'm controlling my own riding and what's going on instead of. Writing for someone else. I always wanted to ride and was always into the news and music and art growing up i really like connie chung. She was like a channel 4 newscaster in the eighties and i love barbara walters. I was a nerd. Tell my sister she doesn't talk to any of the family. And i have a good relationship with my mom i never really knew my dad it doesn't bother me. I have cousins and stuff and everyone scattered across the country so i don't really talk to them and phone we just communicate on facebook. Or like twitter. Oh i go right to sleep. When i get tired i just. Go to sleep. Free good energetic i've been motivated to go look for more van work you know event planning staff and really grinding and more than i was. I mean it's kind of hard cuz you got to talk to people and get them to trust you and. Be that you could plan events and meet people and convince them why they should pay you to do their event than someone else. No. I mean i'm generally pretty happy unless something devastating happens like someone gets cancer someone i know dies. I wouldn't say that i'm just. Super like oh my god happy all the time but it's like an even. Kill that i feel pretty good all the time. I'm very talkative and friendly and i could approach strangers and talk to their meddys and. I could adapt to different situations and even if it's not my scene. Or situation or group of people that i'm used to i could still jump in talk to people and be comfortable and make friends and adopt. I want to make more money. I remember in like 2nd grade the people used to make fun of me cuz i was very tall and skinny and i had like. Strating is where the highest grades and lacrosse so people would make fun of me and call me giraffe. Stuff like that. Very talkative she would just say that i talk to everyone. And i'm very friendly and if you need help. That i'll help someone you know. A recently i went up to oceanside and visited a friend i've known years and we just went out for burgers and hang out on the beach and we got her two-year-old son and like took him to the park and played and. It was really nice and they was cool visiting or i didn't seen her in six months and. It was really fun and i want to go again and. I like the area. Guess maybe i could be trying to find my own work more like for my business instead of working for other people. I think i pursue it but i think maybe i could put a little more time and day into it. I don't really know anything like. So you want a raise or not happen. No i feel good about my traces i made and i think i'm on the right path and. A lot of things i wanted to do the balls rolling and i'm. You know getting things done i'm not as big as i want to be but i feel like i'm on my way there. I'm like 10 years ago i would have told myself to work more in the daytime instead of going out as much as i was. My friend we call mojo. Mojo has a magazine and i just wrote years and he really pushes me to like keep riding and keep doing the vance and keep on the ball i'm rollin and. He's one of the biggest people you know my life tummy you're talented you could do it you know he's just a really. Good like motivation for me. You know being published i've been on tv shows and just getting my own event thing going and. I have a lot of people who read what i ride everyday and follow-on i just think it's a you know it's not exactly anywhere i want to be but it's great start. And i work to get to that point. Great thanks. \n",
      "Yes. I'm doing great how about you. Born in the u.s.a. orlando florida. My parents my dad had a lot of friends in los angeles so excited move here. He was pretty different i mean place i was before was very was a very small town. He probably won't even notice it on the map. Zoe's. Big learning experience on cuz you know the schools were a lot larger in. Different cultures and ethnicities. So it was a unique experience. Last time i. Pinback was probably about 5 years ago. I'm definitely different my aunt she lives in again and she lives in a small town. I'm so if you want to go to a movie theater you have to drive out at least an hour or if you want to go to a mall it's it's an hour drive so. Complete opposite of los angeles. Convenience everything everything i could possibly want is here the weather is great shopping lot of friends here. Sports. Always just kind of like the perfect area you know. And i want to live here. Kind of for the rest of my life actually. Depicting would probably be traffic. I mean. Wherever you go there's going to be traffic with it on the 405 for the 101 it's. It's just traffic you know i can kill like 2 hours in your day which is huge. Quite a bit for a personal info for business site travel you know usually overseas or. I'm domestically. My trouble so and i enjoyed a lot. Sing different places. Different areas meeting new people. Eating different kinds of food. Being able to sightsee and tour if i have a day or. 2 free. I'm just experiencing now i'm having new experiences just in riches my life. I'm computers. And i also did english as well. Yes i am. Where can i t. An it department at a semiconductor company. Probably working for apple. I'm since i pretty much when everything they have be great to work for apple. I'll get it depends there are times when it's good to be alone but for the most part i consider myself an outgoing social person. Nothing too much i guess if you kind of make a promise in you and you break it several times and i might get a little bit. Make it a little bit annoyed but i don't think i would get really mad. Good question i probably say attend a little bit more. Just kind of keep my mind off of a little bit but usually doesn't last that long so it's a product i-10 that you do a little bit more more kind of like maybe junk food or something. I think i'm pretty good i really get mad and if i do doesn't really last that long so i think i'm pretty good. Adam. I guess controlling my temper again i really don't get angry so. Starting issue for me. I said during the elections were talking about president obama and mitt romney and you know who'd be the best fit for the next presidency. A little bit a little bit heated but it was 44 more for fun sake than anything else but it was an interesting conversation. Like to eat out a lot watch movies play video games. Disco out shop play sports watch a laker game if i can in person would be probably the best. Bowling photography like to doing a lot i like to do a lot of different things and of course electronics. Mcl going. Loyal. Intelligent funny. And a great listener. No i have not. No. For most nights it's pretty easy. Just passed avoid drinking coffee or tea before i sleep pretty easy. What's a little bit sluggish tired kind of. Reaction times a little bit slower. Aside from that. Nothing too much like two glaring or anything the usual just being sluggish and. Not moving as quickly as i should. Pretty good. Have no complaints. No. Pretty much the same. Because today i had my car maintenance today and it didn't cost me anything so that's great and i thought it was going to cost me. You know something extra on the side but you know the the service advisor waved it so i got everything free today so i actually have a really good mood. Nothing. I'll probably don't spend as much save more money aside from that. Nothing else just be kind of more. Wise with your money. I'm replacing my best friend. He's kind of a you know help me out and i help them out as well so it's been kind of a great learning experience. Not developing our our friendship and he's bailed me out a couple of times i've bailed him out as well so it's kind of. It's a beautiful thing we do. You know what each other. Encinas equator bond as well. I say probably going back back to korea to visit my relatives. You know they are a lot more different than i remember. 15 years ago when i was a kid i was actually kind of afraid of some of them. But now that i see them you know recently they've actually mellowed a lot in there actually. Pretty fun to talk to so. It was kind of a learning experience for me because there. You know did it complete 180 from when i was at when i was a kid. Guesswork would be part of it. Buying my the car that i wanted. Took a couple years to save up to buy the car but i i paid it all off so i don't think more car payments so that's great too. And you know being able to help my family out as well. Itzy. I was a couple weeks ago i went to las vegas for the. 4cs which is great if you finta gadgets electronics you get to see all the other goodies coming out this year so. That was pretty interesting to see and. Some things that you know when you read on blogs they didn't talk about so you get to see it actually in-person kind of experience it from a user standpoint so i thought it was great. And it's just fun is conecuh being a kid in the candy store you get to play with different gadgets. So it's really fun for me. \n",
      "Alright. And then. Alright. Yeah i'm okay. Fine. Pensacola florida. Met my wife and mississippi and she stays out here so. I moved to la with 2004.

I guess whenever i can. Got 2 years ago. Very pretty close. Not at all. I just don't really have the gift the time in the cash. Nothing not really nothing really makes me that mad anymore. I'm very good at controlling my temper. Not really sure when the last time i said maybe. I'm not really sure but it was just this about you no money. I read the bible. Not really i really don't have anyone right now. Hurricane thing. I really can't tell you i don't know. No. No. No. It's pretty easy. And sleepy. In my behavior they got better. I started going to i gave my life to lord start going to church so i'm just trying to do the right things now. Because i knew that i needed to and life was just. This not the way it should be. A whole lot better. I'm good to hang around you know i like to make people laugh and. And i look out for people. Taking you know i'm not just for myself but. The others and things like that. I just went to disneyland. When my son for his birthday and my and my daughter i really enjoyed that. Yes. That. He sees the one that look just like you and you get the raise them and. And try to you know make sure they do the right things and be better than what you were. Annoying that. I'll evil the world is and your son has to live in it. Used to be hard but. What prayer you know in faith. Everything's going to be alright. They're very. Bass. When we were growing up things was different. You know but now the world is just way worse off than what it is. Then what it was. Flying airplane. For the first time. Yeah i was nervous cuz i've never been on a plane before. So. A little nervous. Scared you can say. Yeah just one that flew back home you know visiting home. Went back for about a week or two. See my family hadn't seen him in a couple years so that was pretty cool. Right now college i'm taking i'm studying. I want to be. Call mariam call culinary arts. Someone's be a chef. I like cooking so i just decided to go ahead and. And i'll get education on it.

So. I'm happy. Cookman. Look cooking puts in a good movie and scene. That my kids are happy. That's cool. No can't say i regret anything. I really don't know. No problem. Bubba. Like someone's really asking me questions. \n",
      "Hashemite hair. Ecriture look like and like all my god i like that. So this picture is not based on a real woman at all. Okay. Yes. I'm doing okay it's still morning so. I'm from the east coast massachusetts. Yes. I moved to la when i was a child with my parents. Pretty much didn't have any choice in the matter. I haven't been back to the last time i was back there was that three years ago for christmas. La's very hustle-bustle there's a lot of people that are angry. And a lot of people don't care about the other person here in la. And which becky is the east coast that the thought pattern is a lot different you know your neighbors are friendly to your neighbors. And anybody that you see in the street. So. Well since i was a kid i was fairly young at first it was rough i was getting in trouble a little bit in school. But. After all that surpassed i did find in high school and stuffing even took some college courses. Well i love the beach. And i love the mountains i like to go hiking. And i like walking along the beach i just live a few blocks away from the beach so it's easy. No. Not at all. It's not interested i've been to mexico a couple of times when i was younger. Went to ensenada but other than that i'm not interested in leaving united states especially with what's been going on lately. Overseas. Actually child psychology and i was in the nursing program for a little bit. But i had some problems at home which caused me to drop out. That's right. I don't have one. To be honest. I admire people that are doing the job that they love i mean like football players they love playing football and they get paid all that money i'll grade is that. I'm pretty outgoing when i meet somebody at first i might be a little bit reserved because we all when we meet somebody passed judgement. As to if we want to. Continue communicating with a person or not. Am but once i've decided i like that person or whatever i. I talk a lot. Yes. I like watching movies. I like i used to like reading but lately. My concentration level hasn't been so great so it's hard to get into a good book. Not good at times. I am i have a. Some outburst every once in awhile today depends on how angry i get. Yesterday. And it was with my partner. And. Actually be honest i don't remember what it was about it's just. Sometimes people can have an ugly attitude and i don't appreciate that and if i feel that i'm being disrespected. Or whichever i'm going to stand up for myself. At times some people may be turned off for my personality because very opinionated and i say what what's on my mind. I do not. Purposely going hurt people's feelings or anything of that nature. But. I won't be bullied and i won't be made i won't back down if i feel like i'm being challenged. Last year my mother died. So. I wish i handled that differ. It up to it that upset me. So. I think i'm going to pass on that one too because that'll upset me more so. That is terrible sometimes sometimes actually falling asleep may not be a problem especially you know when you're done working and doing everything that you have to do in a day you're tired but staying asleep is a whole different thing for me because. It's like i can't die. I get up and then i'm wide awake i'll go out and living room turn on the tv and watch tv i'm lucky if i get 3 to 4 hours sleep. Maybe because i do have a lot of my mind. You know thinking about bills and. The stressfulness of work and all this other stuff so that's probably a big purse. Part of it. But it's difficult it's just frustrating cuz when your mind goes on overtime mode. It just affects everything your concentration your sleep you're eating. Everything so. I look grouchy especially in the morning i'm a morning person. I like the nights but i don't like the morning that's like leave me alone until i get my first cup of coffee. So other than that. I'm okay. Well i've been i've been depressed. For quite some time. And i'm still having difficulty. Cuz after my mother died four months later my uncle died. So i had two deaths last year so i'm still reeling and trying to. Get myself back together just recently i've started pursuing like interest that i used to do. That i haven't done in a year because. What happened. I just. I might get angry little easier i sleep a lot i eat i overeat. I get tired very easily cuz i'm not getting much sleep. So sometimes it's hard it seems like i'm struggling to get through the day. Yes i have a. Psychiatrist that prescribes you medication on a regular basis. Oh i was diagnosed quite some time ago probably. 10 to 15 years ago. And it's just something i've never. Got nowhere i don't know whether or not. You can so i've always taken the medicine. I was. Arguing with everybody in my family my friends and stuff like that and i. Was feeling desperate and hopeless. And i had attempted to take my own life years ago. Which caused me to be hospitalized. And then. Start treating me i start seeing a therapist. Well right now i'm not going to a therapist because my insurance will cover the psychiatrist another therapist. But i am working with a friend of mine who had no some. Avenues to go to seek help for therapist and i don't know if that's really going to help me. I mean sometimes it depends on what kind of therapist you get sometimes people just sit there. And they just listen to you talk and ramble on and you're thinking my god what good is this and the other type is the type that will give you some kind of feedback. As to how to deal with the emotions. Tools to help you deal with your emotions. They said i haven't been going to therapy recently just psychiatrist medication. There's been no changes really. I probably would be doing fine because i was doing great before my mom passed away i was her caregiver. And. Even though a lot of times i build i felt overwhelmed or. Lacked patience with her. I still was a heck of a lot happier. Then i am now. I would say when my son was born years ago. I'm not a parent anymore he passed away. So. And that was difficult as well. I'm extremely organized extremely reliable my work loves me because i get everything done that i'm supposed to get done even though sometimes i feel a little scatterbrained. And. You know those qualities are are admirable and people that can keep their word and and be responsible. Excuse me. Oh i have lots of regrets. Things that i've done in the past i'm not too happy about. But you know i met somebody once in my life. That had had that say nancy it on a bumper sticker. Live to never regret. So you know you can't go back and make changes it's too late. So why you don't dwell on the situation. But sometimes it's a lot easier said than done. I'm at the advice kind of get person. Ino i don't really. Keep my friends ain't kind of advice i mean. I find most of the time people don't listen to you anyway so why bother. I just state my opinion that's all. What right now i'm on a diet because of my overeating. After my mom died i was a lot thinner when she was alive. I just went crazy with the food and sleeping a lot and i'll sleep eat sleep to eat. And so now i'm kind of like on a diet trying to lose this weight is very unhealthy for me. Try and think it's been a long time. Actually there's really nothing because. Now i just keep my mind busy. I haven't been to a movie in ages i don't i used to go out shopping all the time i don't now. Husband is. It's been quite some time since. I've been content and happy with who i am and what i'm doing in my life right now. My weekends like on saturday i'm usually working. On sunday is usually clean up day you know do your laundry clean up the house. Run some errands go shopping for food you know that kind of thing. So. It's not if i was younger you know it would be fun you know got clubbing or whatever but i'm too old for that now. Really there's nothing that i can think of. There's nothing that i can be proud of. Set a good like comedy or whatever i like to watch that. Sometimes my partner might do something stupid which i like. Because i like make fun of them. But. That's it you know maybe go out for a walk on the beach that's it. Okay. No problem thank you. Bye. Does somebody talk for her or she's just talking to me really. Okay. \n",

I like to sit in methodically and logically talk about things. Not raise my voice. Most recently with the illness of my friend i wish i would have handled his sister a little differently as far as. Things that she's wanted me to do. That i really needed to tell her. Otherwise. The way they really needed to be done. I took her advice where i shouldn't have. We i was engaged to him 15 years ago and he recently called me i guess about 5 years ago and told me he was diagnosed with cancer. We've always maintained our friendship. I asked my husband if i could go help him in this time of need and. I'm here. It has been. A lot of things one he's a good friend of mine and his sister moved out here as well. To my son wanted to start his career out here. 3 i love the weather. And that's all i can think of at the moment. I would be the the death of my youngest son. I don't know where to start as far as he was born premature. And since he was born so early i had him in 5 months vs 9. The wii. We made the decision to take him off life support cuz he wasn't getting any better. So that would have been the the hardest decision i made. With my husband. I really don't want to erase anything from my memory. I've actually. Learn and experience and gain knowledge from from things that happen so i'm not. I'm not one to put things erase things out of my mind. I categorize them. And place them in memories. That's very close. Lost my mother at a young age.

That was an education i would be much better equipped to provide services. For the population i was working with. Yes. No. Own my own. Nonprofit organization that provides services for.

I can be i can be really shy but i force myself to be more outgoing. Though i think. People perceive me as very outgoing. I go on facebook. Or i check my emails. Or i watch movies. Comsi comsa. Sometimes i'm really good for the most part. But there are times when i'm feeling very stressed and i have. Temper outbursts of anger outbursts. I don't know about. Maybe. 30 days. Ago. And it was about. My inadequate parenting skills. Ashamed. Angry. Confused. But i also felt like i needed to have. My perspective understood. I have four kids. Three boys and one girl. My oldest son is living in marvista and he's doing some menial job. He's creative and artistic and has a really good heart. My third son is my second son cuz he's my third child. Lives in alabama he has a daughter. And he also has a menial job. But he moved there to be with his. Daughter he's not together with his daughter's mother. And. He's funny and really smart and. Wickedly clever. And my third son my youngest is living in los angeles. Is living on his own. Working in a menial job. It's kind of finding himself. He's extremely kind and sensitive and caring and loving. But he tends to be pretty hard on himself. And has a lot of opinions about a lot of things. I love being a parent but being a parent isn't easy. The unconditional love you feel for your children. Tolerating. Their shortcomings and their suffering. And feeling like. Regret for not having done a better job. I think i tell my children that i love them. And that i'm proud of them and that. I have a much more open communication and. I'm more accepting of the choices. Did they make even though i might not agree with him. Close to my sisters. I'm pretty distant for my mother.

Made me more altruistic and more. Open and less judgment judgmental. Being poor. And unsuccessful. I think i could have made. Better choices. Regarding the. Fathers of my children. And or stepfathers. Maybe. When i. I left my kids. My first marriage. I am. I was really immature and a knowledgeable and felt that i couldn't provide for my children so i made a choice to leave them with her father for a. of time. And that was a regret. And then when i was 36 i was diagnosed with cancer and. I had to make the choice of again. Leaving my kids with their perspective fathers. And.

Why if a guy like a special intense relationships when they lie to you about something that's very minimal. I'm very close to talk everyday. Your family very close even though i don't live with them i try to see them as much as i can. It's okay. It's fine yes i do. They're they're friendly it's just that they're very quiet so i'm not used to that environment. It's fine like the how much it cost is very cheap so that's good and they're friendly so it's fine i just wish it was a little bit it could have been better so. You done anything to avoid it yes. I had a different option to live with somebody else. And i'm still friends with the female and come to find out that we connect more than roommates that i live with so i kind of regret moving in with roommates i have now versus who i was supposed to move in with in the beginning. So but i'm set for a year so it's whatever. How do you know them. I don't know who. Yeah. Listen to natalie gets music that i can think of that's out of my head. Baby when it comes to schools how they treat the children especially children of color maybe. How do i get to mad. Yes because i do think it's from within i guess internally motivated to do things i guess yeah. Yeah. When was the last time you argue with someone. Wow i hardly ever argue with somebody yeah. Oh my sister i guess my sister that was about a month ago. I felt very betray and belittled because she's my little sister and she shouldn't be. Disrespect me in any type of way cuz i'm an adult so yeah i was not feeling the situation at all. Can you tell me about that. Just her getting into grown folks business and it was a conversation between me and my mother and i guess you overheard what it was being fed and she felt like. Through my actions that i was choosing somebody else over my family when that wasn't even the cake because she know the whole situation she just automatically assumed and put stuff on facebook about me disrespecting me calling out my name and it was yeah so if you didn't come see me about it. Yeah so but i mean we're fine now so that's good. Tonight believe people so easily. So gullible is not be so gullible. I guess i've been hearing that lately how i believe anybody anything that's why he says about really thinking about it or without having them prove it so i guess you can say i'm a lot of mistakes i don't want to say i regretted it because i'm glad i went through while younger than me so. Yeah i believe people too easily and i get people to his chances so yeah. When i went on a cruise which was to have experienced when i went on a cruise to mexico with my family when i was 16 56 years ago. Trying new things sing new views of the world i'm trying a different type of foods seeing how the government is and how they run the things out there i guess. Yeah i plan to go to the bahamas next year i played a lot of traveling last year actually. That's pretty good. I'm tired and i kind of fall asleep during class and whatnot. Yeah it's my fault though. Probably today. Or i fell asleep late so it's my fault. I'm not so pretty happy right now. No. Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd. No. Very friendly and funny. Talkative. High school.

Experiencing different things. Same different cultures. Well i was stationed in germany for three years it was a great experience. Food was great. Bavarian alps. The snow. The people. I loved it. Having a baby. Lotus the most memorable thing in my life something i'll never forget. Great. One friend. Grown. Handsome. Father-of-two. No. It's actually very hard for me. Not becoming angry. Too quickly. Being able to cultivate. A mind. Love someone unconditionally. Well i went through a lot of trauma as a child so as a parent i was very afraid for my child to go to that thing trauma. Tried to protect him from it. I think it's really hard cuz you never really know people on what they'll do. Outgoing. Because if i'm in a room with people i'm usually. The first one to start talking. What are you doing. Doesn't matter fact i have fish aquarium. That's what. Keeps me calm. Not very good. Seems like everyday argue with somebody about something but yesterday. Lady tried to cut line. In the grocery store and i flatly told her i was in line and. She didn't want to move. Yes. It have. Because. Sometimes if people don't want to move then i feel it's my place to move them. Hurting people. Physically. If i feel disrespected or somebody puts their hands on me i can get very ugly. I don't like that about me. I was pulled over by the police and they had. Someone with my name. And they were very rude to me and. I really wasn't happy with the way they treated me. How to. Stay calm when. Someone has. Crossed over into my boundary. My personal space. I can't let people get too close to me if they do i lash out. I don't want anybody in my. Area of. Protection i guess. Stay away from people. Stay away from. It's hard you can't live in this world without other people. Sometimes i just irritate the heck out of me. Being assaulted in the military something i wish i could forget. Just that i felt. Helpless alone ashamed and angry. That's about all i want to go into it. 18. Because i was assaulted in. And. I have a fear of. People in uniform. Like policemen hurting me or. Other military veterans. Hurting me when they. Explode or go off or. Have issues of. Ptsd. Remember. I work for the federal government. Well just seem like a normal progression. Federal government gives you ten point preference over other people for being in the military. Sing like a natural choice. Organization that had a book of rules and they followed them. The government one government to another. Yes. Well it was hard in the sense that in the military you're given. You told to handle it handle it. And in the civilian world you have to go through so many hoops and. Different people to talk to to get something done. Administration of justice. No i don't work anymore. Oh yeah. Almost two years. The feeling that i was. Always going to be hurt that someone was out to get me. I had nightmares panic attacks anxiety attacks. Out. Outbursts of anger. I was always in emotional pain. And i always wanted to hit somebody. Yes mostly disrespect but i feel it's disrespectful people getting too close to me or. I feel in fear of them for some reason. I can't remember the last time i had a good night sleep. What. Irritable angry moody pissed off. Irrational. Tired. Sick of the world angry at the world. Wanting to be left alone. Sometimes i don't want to go on. Yes. Oh yeah oh yeah. Well i i could recognize a trigger now when something is going to trigger me i can at least. No. Anda. Act accordingly if i want to. When i fill my grandchildren when they came to visit. If you're so innocent and sweet and precious it was just. A joy to have them around 8. Make me forget about all the pain in life. Planting seeds for some vegetables. Making a garden. I read somewhere that it's calming and soothing to work with your hands and dirt so i decided to find out. Plant something and watch it grow. Sitting on the beach look facing the water. Thinking talking to god. Wishing i was somewhere else. Kauai. Penthouse over maui. That i could trust people. That i wouldn't last shout at them. I could sleep at night. Crazy. Hard-headed. Emotional. Being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Don't trust anyone. Be careful be wary of people and what they. Want from you. I said. My grandchildren. I don't have a real family i haven't seen my brothers in like 20-30 years. I only have two brothers and i don't haven't seen them. My mother's family. I haven't seen in years my father's family haven't seen in years my. Parents are dead and my son lives in another state. Wow. Some of the older people that i. Give care to. Sometimes i'm a caregiver so sometimes the people that i work with older and wiser. I'm loyal. Spiritual. Supportive. Kind. Generous. Bye. \n",
      "Okay. Hi. Yes. I'm doing well. I was born in oakland. All the different areas of the city. The different cultures that are here. The traffic. The. Lack of public transportation. And the superficiality. I'm sure you can tell.. I i don't i would love to travel more. Being able to experience a different way of living. Getting outside the bubble that you normally live in and. Getting a different perspectives. I'm in 2008 i studied abroad in brazil and that was about 4 months. And i was in bahia which is in the north. And. See the program consisted of learning the history learning the language and staying with a homestay family. I've always wanted to travel and i chose brazil because. They have an afro brazilian population or large afro-brazilian population which i really want to learn more about and i think that history in the culture is really interesting. I think taking a bus by myself to. A remote beach. And just navigating on my own and figuring out where to go. Yeah. Right now i'm getting my masters in social work. Dream job. I think to consult. About mental health and. How to. How to intervene effectively with different cultures. And doing research and consulting work and getting to travel. Basically that those would be the main characteristics. I think that's a false. Dichotomy. But i do consider myself shy but at the same time outgoing in the sense that i push myself to do things outside of my comfort zone. And i'm determined to do what it takes to become successful. What are you doing. I listen to music. And just lay in my bed and. I guess you could say do mindfulness and really just take my mind off of things. Also breathing exercises which i'm learning more about as well as exercise. Pretty good i don't get angry lot. So as far as. Angry temperament i'm pretty good at that. Month is may. Probably two months ago. And i argued. Via text message so it's not really intense arguing but. I guess you call it arguing in a sentence over whether or not i should be forgiven for something that i thought was minor. With a friend i've had four. Few years. How do you feel. I felt. Anxious. Sad and angry. Yeah those are the main emotions. How do you know. I know them because i think i'm pretty in touch with my emotions and being able to identify them and then i'll notice the physical. Manifestations of emotions like if if my heart's racing or from getting sweaty. If i'm. If my breathing is more shallow i'll know i'm anxious i'll know something's bothering me. That i wish i had handled differently. I guess related to this argument. I went out one night and. God. A little too intoxicated and ended up. Calling a person for a ride. Home. But that. Really upset that person. And i know that. It wasn't such a big deal but i wish i hadn't have. Let myself get to that point. It impacted a relationship and i also felt really bad about. What i did. Hardest decision. Wow. Probably deciding what type of graduate program to go into i briefly went to law school and decided not to do that so afterwards. After dropping out i had to really. Rethink what it is that i wanted to do and what i wanted to. Dedicate my life to go into debt for. It's been a lot of energy on. I think by recognizing what i don't want to do. And doing a lot of research on. Program requirements and the jobs that you can get after completing a program. After think. Revolving around the same person i've spoke of earlier. It was a dating relationship and. A few years ago we had a falling-out. Over. His treatment of me. And involved. Another person and i wish i could. Get that out of my mind. Tell me about your relation. I have a pretty good relationship with my mom she lives in the bay area i didn't grow up with her but i've gotten. I'm closer to her as an adult. We talked pretty regularly with my dad i grew up with him. Mostly he lives in atlanta and. We don't talk as much but. We are. They were pretty decent relationship it's not really that. Contentious or anyting. And i'm an only child. So i don't have siblings i don't have a large family. I'm so. In general i'm not really. That close to family. One person is my mentor who i met in 2005. And she's a judge and i met her when i was in community college and she really. Open my eyes to possibilities and made me feel that i would be able to achieve. Certain things. Pretty easy it's easy for me to sleep. What's not easy is. Getting up. Because usually i do not. Look forward to what i have to do that day and the thought of it is. You know just makes me want to stay in bed also i wake up pretty tired. Not really feeling refreshed. I think just. Self talk about how would i have to do. Isn't that bad or that the things that i'm doing now or going to end pretty soon with the end of the school year. Trying to think of things that i can look forward to in the week. I'm also listening to music. And browsing the internet kind of gets my mind going. Feeling. Oh wow. Feeling. Emotionally drained in some ways. And. At the same time feeling like i've accomplished a lot and i've grown. So mix of ambivalence. And feeling drained and a mixture of. Feeling accomplished and proud at the same time. No i haven't. Yes. And 2006. The convergence of a lot of stressful factors. I was out of touch with my mom i started why i transferred to a university that was pretty rigorous. And just all those changes going on. Really. Exacerbated. Things that were already there depressive tendencies that were already there. And it got to a point where i just felt really overwhelmed. Yes i do. Yes. I noticed. I'm better able to. Accept my emotions and not judge them and also identify them. I'm. Able to. Think differently about things that happened maybe look at things in a more positive light. And also identify. The areas i need to work on and the underlying issues. In those areas. Tell me about the. This past weekend i reconnected with some old friends and it was really good to see them and be back in touch again. Awesome. People have different takes on me i don't have one best friend but i think people would describe me as very. Analytical. Sensitive intelligent. Intellectual. I wish that i did not. Orally. I wish. I was better able to cope with my anxiety and depression which i'm working on. And. I wish that i had more energy. Start going to therapy now. But yeah i really would and. Also. To what. How old am i. 28. 10 years ago 18 okay so graduating from high school. I would. Tell myself to pick up some more job skills that i wouldn't have to struggle as much in the future. And to seek out mentors. To get it clearer. Idea what i wanted to do as a career. I think the fact that i'm in grad school. And. Coming from the background that i that i come from. Low socioeconomic status. And. Just pushing through. Challenges to get here. You're welcome. Bye. Okay. \n",
      "Yes perfectly fine. I'm feeling great sunday early morning i don't have school. I'm excited. Born and raised in los angeles california. The fact that you can serve snowboard and like. Do to drastically different things in one day. Coming from the neighborhoods i've lived in i'd say the population of. Lower socio-economic backgrounds it's like cesspool almost for young african-americans and it sucks. Not really i've been to new york connecticut mexico and texas but. Pretty young. Mostly if i'm traveling by plane just decide in the air is amazing for markleville. The first time i went to new york i was about 11 years old. And i made sure i got the the window seat on the plane and just a feeling of taking off is just exhilarating but. We left. At night here in la and it was the next day in new york so it was kind of confusing getting used to the time change. The first thing i remember doing is getting a slice of new york pizza. It was it was delicious. Graduating with the bachelor's degree in communications. So i can go into the military as an officer. Actually like i don't know it's like. You got to have a plan. It's the only thing that's just fallen into place and it seems like it's going to fall into place for me. To be honest job that doesn't exist. However you can get paid to do nothing. Yeah. Probably. I was definitely shy as a kid but i've grown into myself through the experience of college way more outspoken. I write music and i work out mostly so if i'm feeling stressed out i just do a set of push-ups and lifting weights. I'm pretty good. I saw a therapist when i was a kid for about a year. And i don't know if tommy to just be able to control my emotions and i don't think i do it in the best way because when i'm angry i do. Decide to like just bottled in my emotions in instead of letting them out in their appropriate outlets. Not really it's been more of a in interpersonal thing that's. I don't know. Probably yesterday something in regards to sports the playoffs are on so things like that that nature. So many. I guess in my senior year of high school i waited till the last minute to apply for the uc schools and it was unsuccessful because i didn't get to turn in applications and i'm pretty sure i would have been admitted. So it sucks but. Hey. That is an intriguing question. I've actually no clue. The death of my grandmother. Sure. My grandmother died when i was 11 years old. She raised me from the time i was born because my mother was unable to take care of me. Today is my sister my brother and my cousin as well and her five children so she was the matriarch of our family. The closest thing i've had to a mother. It was tough but. It's going to be seven years this may next on the 30th. And i know i've grown quite a bit no more tears. I'm a foster kid so i was emancipated from the foster program about 2 years ago now. But i'm pretty close. As i can and i'm a foster family they're awesome i've known him since i was five so it's been pretty cool. Fairly easy i fall asleep pretty quick it's not a problem except for when my back's hurting and then it's a problem. A little moody in the morning i guess i drive more aggressively. A little stressed about a few problems that i can take care of but i shouldn't stress because i either can do something about it or i can't mess this way things work. Usher. I have a few parking ticket not parking tickets are not moving violations but their tickets. And i was unaware of if you missed court without being in the hospital or being in jail. That you couldn't be excused from not been making your court date so i have. 3 failure to appear in court would suck. Tickets that are thousands of dollars and i have no money so. I don't know this it's pretty tough to deal with when you trying to make something out of your life but. There's so many barriers and obstacles that like you didn't foresee so i don't know it gets stressful at times and. Yeah. Thinking about it for periods of times some days i just i'm just lost in my thoughts and i don't really communicate to anyone because there's nothing anybody can do for me really. So i just bought a lit up like i do. Everything. Not very after. Doing it for so long it becomes a natural thing i believe. No. No. Really happy. Why is that such a difficult question. I don't know i'm pretty content with everything right now i don't know about extreme happiness everyday is just a same day. Seems like. Dunking. Across the street at the clippers center is a basketball court there. And i've been working on it for a while and i finally got up. Yeah. Have. For close friends that i've known for over. 8 years each. I don't know studios hard-working. Determined. I don't know. Yeah. Probably my metabolism which i don't really have control over so i don't know i'm pretty content with myself. I think in my sixth-grade year of. Grade school. I was i was in the best of students but. I had a teacher who is diligent and like he felled me the whole year but i learned a lot and i developed a passion for school afterwards sews like a situation i overcome after feeling so bad. And down. The same teacher who made me feel really bad actually because it wasn't for his like sternness i don't think i would have. Game the discipline to be where i am at now in college and stuff so i'm pretty influential. I remember this time i was in the desert or up in joshua tree with my best friend and his dad. And we actually got stuck in the mountains and like we went down a gully. And his jeep wouldn't get over a rock so it was it was pretty yeah it was it was kind of weird i thought i was superman i try to move a rock. That was thousands of pounds didn't work. But yeah we eventually got out. we're going to be stuck in the desert but it was a fun time i got to drive in the desert when i didn't have my license owes fun. About that day or in general. Other than like puc thing like when i didn't apply to the schools in time. I regret that. I don't know i was i was 10 years old. I probably say to myself. No clue. Especially interesting question. Being the first for my mediacom immediate family is in my mother my brothers and my sister to go to college. So yes. Miss pretty. No problem. Sentences. \n",

It has a great place but it's not such a cool place to go i take something like boston how do you say go to a locked. Now you know everybody i talk to is like a little bit nervous about it it should go there you know to do you know y'all have a great time you know you're acting is because i just happened kind of you know choice off track of it make you rethink. Is that a good getaway spots till right now sound like a fan. How many i. I take walks. Hi call the friends we have tea or something. I think i'm pretty much got that under control. It's probably something silly in a work situation that lasts about 5 minutes and. Pretty much having fun again. I don't really dwell on. Negative things too much. I don't have any regrets right now. I really can't think of anything right off the top. Brown decision i've ever had to make. Was. Not hiring a good friend. For a job.. You know the one qualified for. That's hot. And because you have to explain to them that it's not too. Friendship your hiring is still competence. My father. I just saw. Taught me how to. You know what,. Difficulties when i was growing up and how important it was to not give up. And be able to see the bright side of any situation your face because it goes away in a few hole-in-the along enough. And i are found out to be true so. It's okay except for somebody. Distance siblings you know i don't see as often as i can. I was just you know when you bring your travel quite a bit you just don't see people goes dinner always there you know. There's nothing like yeah. Well you know i'm i get pretty excited if i'm working on something on developing something so. I tend to overlook the time sometime but other than that. Yeah whatever but i'm out i'm out that's it. Well. I guess i'll be a little bit off. Trying to figure out how i'm going to get sleep. It all seems like an angel. I'll try not to be grumpy or anytime just probably feel overtired. I feel okay now. Changes. Like what. Well, hopefully future i see you. Asher lot of new things unfolding i mean from that perspective yes. Nope. Never. I feel okay now. I went to great parties last week. That was really cool. Well it was like on a rooftop. It's a lot to really are. Nice people. Who are basically in the same kind of file. Mindset. Pursuing the same type of. Kohl's. I don't resolve quite inspiring actually. I got a lot information. I know a lot of good connections were made. Awesome guy awesome absolutely awesome. Party weekend. Is a. Cooking my own food. Relaxing. You know i'm if i'm in the mood for. Company. I have friends in. Family members join me. Well.

Miss mystery do you know if you kind of like a. If you look different or you're in a different type of car. It's a different set of things. Make you excited. You're into a different way of thinking. People tend to misjudge you. Yeah and. That's used to make make me really be upset sometime. But. Yeah i kind of figured it out and i'm pretty much over that you know so i see it as their loss and not mine you know if they didn't get to know me you know. hey. Maybe they don't need to doesn't really bother me i'm kind of. Work those things out in time you know. Yeah. My best qualities of opium. Listening i think. Honda. Maybe just talkin. Johanna conversational level. Sometimes people tend to burden me with everything they got because of that. But you know. I guess it is that's probably why it seems like umberto so. When i when i see too much of that i just saw pull back. Go for your dream. Believing what you doing. Don't let anyone discourage you. And you'll be okay. And that's the way i feel now that it's kind of be bald itself. Postpartum. I think my. My mind mike spiritual relationship you know. I might like my settlements about. Not being too too anxious about. But things are going around me and being able to see that. You know down no mistakes that really happen. And you shouldn't really eat. Never lies have to be defeated.

I have a business owner a businessman that i worked for who was it extremely positive influence at least in my professional life. I've had to. A counselor at ucla who was totally i think of her. Often. And some of the little things that she said to me. Keep me going in my life now. Trust the process. She told me to trust the process. And when people are having trouble and i'm having trouble i take it step back and say. You know just trust the process it it it all works out the way it's supposed to be. I'm just one more.

I you know i have pain in the mornings and in the evening i have pain throughout the day in front with my back. And it's a it's a little depressing you know i get depressed also. You know just thinking about. My business that i sold and. You know where i would have been if i hadn't of done that attend. A general feeling of. I've been a little depressed over the past couple of years actually. Yes. Well i've been diagnosed many many years ago and i guess depression stays with you although it gets treated. And i was diagnosed about 2 years ago. I think i don't know what to ask me that on the questionnaire as well. Angela and i sought treatment. For it and then my insurance ran out. And the prescriptions. I couldn't put that do my prescriptions anymore but now i'm back on medication. And. So i take medication for my depression. Therapy absolutely. I love therapy. Wow that's huge confidence and self. Confidence in myself confidence in my decision-making. The general feeling of. Overall content. A sounding board. You know when i have stuff that's bothering me that i can't. Go to the. But i feel that i can't go to the person with. I. Can go to my therapist in. A lot of times the issue is resolved there it wasn't a big issue or i worked through it or the therapist through the therapist allowed me to look at a different way of looking at the situation. And in that way i find therapy to be. Invaluable actually. I believe so. Yes i was. I believe it was. He was told to me by a psychiatrist that that's what i was that's what i was having. And this was within the last. 5 years i think it was. Looking back now. What are we 2013 it was 2009. So four years ago. I'm not able to deal with like shell-shocked not able to deal with anything irritable on the phone i mean just. Yeah just. Anything would get me to fly off the handle and just not able just shell-shocked and. Not in hiding at my in my house not opening mail not being able to concentrate not being able to deal with. With things that were that i felt were will that were bombarding me i felt overcome. And. The psychiatrist said that it was supposed to medic stress disorder but. And i was given some medication which i stayed on for a year or so. Or so and i don't know through. Psychiatry and therapist and medication i was able to come out of my shell little bit. About a week ago i was on a hike. And up in malibu and at this beautiful labrinth. That looked over the pacific ocean and i was with a friend and we were having lunch. And i laid down in the grass. And took a nap. And i felt content i was happy at that moment that that. Norman's. That time. About a week ago. Honest sincere. Smart. Caring. Smart. Good question. I'd have to think about that. Yeah i have regrets in life. Everything works out. So. You know if i could change the past i would have never dropped out of school. When i did a long time ago i mean i've since gone back and completed lots of stuff. I probably would have gone into the military. I think i was going to do that in my early twenties. M55 now. I sort of regret not doing that. At that time. I regret. Selling my business. I regret. But of course i can't control this but i regret. That my father died when i was so young and. He never really got to know me and i never really got to know him. I regret. I regret not seeing. My grandmother enough before she passed away. I regret. I mean those are the things that i can think of right now not putting away for retirement i regret. When i had the money to do it. Yeah. I mean. Just here that's what i would say. Stick with it. Just stick with it because in order to get. I'll do you have to go through. And. I when it comes to fear or flight i get the fear and i flight. So sometimes you just have to sit in fear and. Then. Everything works out. Wow. I'm most proud that i have remained. Genuine. I must. Proud. Of. Being who i am. And being basically comfortable with that. And i'm proud of that i haven't changed. To the warp to the world you know for the world i haven't changed i stayed. Who i am. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. \n",

You know what i'm mad i really don't want to be you know talking to people i don't like to yell i don't have to scream when i'm at the hit i don't like to fight. I kind of close down a lot i don't know what you want to be left alone. Sometimes i tend to drag it on for longer than it should be. And the wife doesn't like it too much and. Maybe you know. I just don't i just don't want to talk cuz i want to deal with it it kind of close down and shut you know. Shut off for a little bit. Cheese. Doesn't happen too often. Maybe with my wife. You know it'll probably be something silly who knows. Who knows. I don't have a lot of guilt i don't do anything like. To make me ever feel like you know that bad of a person you know. There are things that like. You know. Call minor sins. White lies whatever you don't like nothing that's so atrocious that makes me feel like guilty. Let's see i guess. Sometimes you know. You know. I'm very guy but you know sometimes the times you know i like to. You know smile at a girl or like you know get a girl's attention you know i don't know i never go do anything about i never get the phone number. Like you know. Sometimes i like to lake. Talk to people. Well that's a good question. I guess. I guess. You know. The same but there's not i don't ever wish to deliver. Change the handle things differently i always kind of i'm pretty comfortable the way i handle things. And you know i think that. I could be a lot worse in like you know shouting and screaming and hitting in this and that. And that's just not me. You know i think the best thing to do you know it's kind of like. Get a lot of breathing room a lot of space and. I don't wish. For that to change or. To handle any that differently i just don't basically know what else to do. You know. And you know the last thing i want to do is start talking about you no feeling during either you know. Last thing i want to do and so like i don't wish that i handle things like that differently in that way. Well you know i'm pretty happy with my family right now you know if i'm married and we have a baby along the way. Which is kind of nice. Missing cats thank you thank you if cats and a dog. A weenie dog and my mom i love my mom dearly. She has babies which you know she doesn't control. You know she doesn't control it and like. It leg affects your health and those has me worried about her and i stressing out about her. You should do so much too late for vanity and she doesn't sand. You know i have a good relations with my mama i love her dearly. And actually have a good relationship with everybody i think i think i have a ton of family and friends. Dave get along with me pretty well actually you know. There are times when minutes pretty easy for me to go to sleep actually i feel like you know i sleep like a baby. The only problem i have. Icing. Is i feel. Like you know sometimes that you fall asleep and you have you just going to sleep and you can kind of like. You know like it almost kind of like fall that it is i-gos fallen sensation or something like that. And it doesn't happen that often but it happens. And for the most part and i sleep really good. Well right now generally i've been feeling. Worried and anxious and. You know. Intense. The reason why i suggested my mom right at least today i found out my mom something she didn't tell me the whole story and i'm kind of waiting. To this is over so we can i can find out what's wrong with her. You know i'm worried about her she's she's at the doctor's right now so that doesn't tell me anything good. And you know i'm trying to find a job so that has me worried too. You know the baby along the way so that has me worried so i feel like. You know overwhelmed with a just a lot alike in things to do in like. And i'm. A lot of my plate in leg. A lot of it doesn't have anything to do with me but i have to handle it late you know so like. I guess. Well i keep myself distracted i keep myself busy i feel like a busybody you know and the more it seems like it's not a good thing because i feel like i'm just. So. You know like one of things i do is like exercising so i have to work out everyday you know what that takes an hour that takes an hour to like you know chatting change and you just start writing and legos to the whole thing of stretching and. Cooling down a text to take some time and then take a shower and all that kind of stuff it takes time so but have to do a daily buy cope with it and that way i also cope with it to you know playing guitar but that's just. More of a distraction you know what i mean keeping you know keeping busy that way it just seems like it's not. You know. Working towards you know the goals. You know that i need to do like you don't find it in the job which it should be doing. But then. In all it's one of those things were like i find that. There's no good jobs i've been looking and looking and like something and i do it it's just not what i want to do it just as it seemed. Like. I want a leg. Do these lay terrible jobs. You know it's it's. Call harder than i'm thinking about it because sometimes i feel like. You know what he thinks he's like. I feel like it is hard. But it's not. I mean there are ways i can cope with it. You know i just got out i could have accepted it a lot and internalize it. And like you know. It's not something that's like i'm out on the street or anything like that. You know it is a worry. I've never been diagnosed with ptsd i used to work with. No. Man. The last time was really happy movie. We nothing i feel like nothing makes me happy no more you know i learn a new song on the guitar i feel like not even happy about that you know i feel like when i work out sometimes. kind of makes me happy you know running like you know fast and working out but that doesn't make me so excited or anything like that it just makes me feel good. You know so i have these these. These times where i'm just you know feeling good. About myself in a feeling you know but i'm never feeling great america feeling happy and they're feeling like. So sensationalize that you know. And you know. Incredible that you know i just. Analogous mile times with a few good times.

You know it's like pointless even like you do look for these kind of jobs like. It just seems like i just wish i had a little more inspiration and not more motivation delay. 2. Do things. The one thing i regret is is not. Is not you know it's this lsat. You know. You know. Not passing the test again with cuz i'm sure i could have got into it at school but then again later you know it has me thinking like do i really want to pay once you let you know law school. Tuition and the cost of that and they. You know just to. Just to be power down with more work and things like that. I don't know you just didn't seem like. Like. There is this idea of justice and. And i'm. And republicanism. And you know things that i really don't care to. That i fall in love with. I don't want to get away from. But it's just seems like it's a lot of work and money. And just to lake for the smalls. Percentage of success. That you know you might not be able to do in that kind of field you might hear it just didn't seem like. Lake. It's worth overcoming the obstacles i need to overcome. I have no idea i would have 20 years ago. I would tell myself maybe. And i think i've done everything really well for myself except for the outside thing you know which is. In a regret on one hand on the other hand. You know i'm not sure if i regret cuz about the bills and all that kind of stuff i told you about. Antenna. I think you know i've waited to get married and waited to have a kid. You know pretty cautious about theirs and i don't take drugs i don't drink i don't fight i don't do any of these like things that like you know that. I think that real people have handle. And they really like you to ruin their life you know so like. Pretty happy and content with. Being in all the cautious you know. I don't know. Oh my best friend i think he kind of likes what he wishes. That i would do more things with him but he works at night. And and it'll it's one of the things i think most people not just my best friend but my wife. And might be reversed my family. So that i don't put an out of. Time and attention to them. And think that i'm pretty great when i do give them my. Time of day and my attention. But i don't know if i'm really there all the time you know i don't know if i'm really. You know i'm always thinking about something else i'm always thinking about something different. I don't know if i really can give you a real. You know soul to cry on or. You know if they ask for something you are usually do it. You know but i almost feel like it's like a chore like you know legacy. You know. They really need me then i'll do it you know if it's just asking for a favor. Atmosphere you know i do have a lot of lackluster that i have hardness. I just stopped because i hate when she said i feel like. I almost want to say i owed to them but the mere fact that i'm their friend makes them somehow. You know. Like you know they are friends. I just feel like it. It's more it's not it's not it's more like a chore. To do instead of a. Willingness letter on my god like i just want to help you is that it's never like that it's just something that i do because i kind of have to do you know you got to go to do things for your friends you know in the end because they're your friends you know they probably would do it for me. And i and also i just do these things you know just. Well there are a couple of things that i do like. That i feel good about myself you. And i ran the la marathon that kind of felt good you know. I've graduated from college that kind of feels good you know what i mean. But the thing is i don't feel like. Like that proud of myself. 4. You know those things alone like. Graduated from college. Has it really made me successful. You don't even. Winning the marathon has it made me thin trim. They're like. Half merrick's you know we're like the great except friday. But. You know they're kind of like stepping stones at like. Are you still real newton oh. Life. Long. Benefit from doing other than the fact that i can say that i've done. Yeah yeah no problem no problem thank you for your time you know. I hope you enjoy it. I've been in this computer. Oh goodbye. I'm going to sleep right now. I think we're good here. Yeah. \n",
      "What's i going to see a psychiatrist. Cool. Okay. Iq. Sure. I'm good. But i caught a cold. Prodigy. Ellie. Embrace. It's home. Food depot. Culture. Traffic. Do anyways probably. I have in the past. I'm traveling lately. The destination i don't enjoy the traveling anymore though i did when i was young but no water it's a destination point. 92 into spain. And my grandma my father's mother this morning spain i went back to trace her roots. I spent a week in madrid and we can barcelona and the weekend mallorca. Had a great time. Hydraulic. It was an everyday thing people are friendly. Friday night. Some things about my grandmother and her family are interesting. I studied poli-sci and sociology. What's the time it seemed like the easiest thing to do. Now now. I have a dream job for awhile voice research for our native american tribes. But the. I enjoyed it. But it's it's not as. As often as it was. Mainly because of the. Sports bureau that exist now that didn't exist when i started. Crystal when i do i still enjoy it. I'll be with it but i'll be with suits me in any given situation. What are you doing. Listen music. I like oldies. Jazz. Soft music. I've learned it well it wasn't always that way but i'm going to do it one. But when i buy you a super mean words. But with my youngest daughter. I was about to year-and-a-half ago. What was it stemmed over this city i didn't like what the. The way your husband said something to her and it bothered me and when i told her she got it. Extremely defensive and rather than deal with it she became she became angry with me. I was mad. Three girls. 3837 31. Three granddaughters. 11-14-18 so i haven't won an argument a long time. But i had oral sex something. When i don't really consider myself a parent. Just wanna grow my baby's 3120a you never lose that but i'm in my parenting at this point in my life. I'm enjoy my grandchildren. When i was a parent yet so difficult job. Getting getting to their level and understanding what they understand i don't understand. And i putting your your stuff in front of theirs. Hugs. Well my dad was with physical in those days you notice. nobody called child services if you got hit. My mother was very loving but my dad. I adored my mother my dad was a hard guy. But i love him. I never felt abused by him but i mean. The one thing i remember you said when you when your cable kicking my ass you can leave this house. Let's make that skyler basis of our relationship. My mother. My kids my grandkids. I'm one of them one of the three three sons. I really didn't have any experience with the females other than with my mother in terms of being the unrelated. And my grandma. Animal my first daughter was born it was like wow. Tell madly in love with her. Change my life. That's what happened. When my mother got sick i wish i wasn't there for her the way i should have been. But i don't feel good. Oh yeah you can always fix what you did with you. I was just in a real bad situation. But that doesn't excuse the fact that i wasn't there the way i should have been. At least out of my mind. Why my second marriage probably she. She wanted to have children already had my children with my first wife. And. I thought i had told her initially that i did not want to have children if you're not going to head three. And i was good with that and. She indicated that she. Did not want to have children so we got married and then her best friend guy. Pregnant. And our relationship changed and. I basically wouldn't relent and we had to get a divorce. I don't know what i would have had to. Would have had children with her but i. I wasn't very flexible in the process. What to be flexible. Sometimes i am sometimes or no. Haven't pulled my. For my father out of offer life support. I just kept going back to something he said to me when i was younger. But he would come back and haunt me. If i lay there and suffer. Took me a while to convince mother two brothers but. That's what we do. Can i get erased from my memory. Being locked up for a while. Like the reset for my memory. It's an everyday hell. Where there's very little humanity. And. You got to do some things that you're not proud of. I've never slept i've never slept a lot and i'm one of those people that. If i wake up i have a hard time going back to sleep. What's a really tired then you know. I'm pretty much so with the same. Oil change. Socialite. Things are good with the kids and the grandkids except for the living set with my granddaughter at my doll youngest daughter but i had a friend recently it was. Runned over in a crosswalk and then he song. He's on life support so i've been feeling to go to bed. It's affected me. Was like he was jaywalking and he literally was walking in the crosswalk and the guy never even hit the brakes. And he's on life support at this point. But i really wanted to consist of thing about me is i'm very inconsistent. No. No. But i've had moments where i thought i was i was depressed. Okay was talking when you were talking to eddie hill's question. Yesterday. Had a conversation with my fortune your granddaughter. I'm happy i have moments of happiness everyday cuz i usually speak to. Text with my daughters and granddaughters everyday. Even if. Website with one another. I have a lot of regrets. I should have went to law school. That's that's kind of something i thought you got to think about more in my lifetime. I was accepted i just didn't i had other other things i thought i wanted to do. I played with wanting to be a kicker for football on the football team. Hatsan tryouts things like that. But didn't pan out. And as as that didn't pan out i sort of lost my zest for wanting to be a lawyer. Just did other things. I'll take a big that was difference i probably wouldn't listen to myself. By myself. I can be. If i don't like you i can be very very difficult. If i don't like you. I'd very much like to change it. It has in the past year. Well i just threw that you you can make me feel bad about myself only if i let you. And i'm not real big on that letting people do that to me but my first wife when. When she left. What's the children she you know that it was my fault. I wasn't sure that i believe that but i knew i was an ass. Amanda. So i probably believe in not in its totality but in part. I'm very i'm not judgemental i will listen to anybody. Whether i agree with you or disagree with you. I've taught myself to. Control anger that i that i have. And if if i call you my friend or if i tell you i love you i mean it that's that's not something that i do. Casually. Okay why i played 18 holes of golf with her. With an old dear friend we got caught up and. Week 4 hours on the golf course 2 hours at dinner. That is your wife. Have a good time. A lot a lot of memories came back. Why when i like my grandkids i like that mean i like the hell out of them. I don't have all kids in like that i think they're like too much on relied too much on technology but. But that's me mainly cuz i don't. But if my grandkids are any any sampling of it i think they're good victor pretty good. I raised my girls. Basically by myself with the help of my mother. I think that's they are most probably. Okay nice chatting with you. Already. Nice going.. \n",
      "Okay great thanks. Yes. I'm doing fine. California here in los angeles. I love being near the beach and i love the beach. I love living in a big city. And i love the fact that i have lots of friends and family here. Traffic. Just so many sometimes too many people. But apart from that i i'm generally happy here. Photography and language studies. I love photography. I was always interested in it and set it in high school as well so i wanted to continue to learn more about it and with languages i come from a mixed background so i wanted to learn the languages. Of my ethnic background. It wasn't hard it was a passion so i enjoyed it. Are you still awake. I'm not no. To do photography full-time and also to do some of the things that i'm passionate about more creatively more creative things. I have an idea i'd like to do. Make some i like a robe line women's robes and things like that. Do you travel a lot. I have traveled quite a bit and i didn't i love trouble. Seeing different cultures different countries meeting new people all about. And language. I lived in greece for. Over a year i taught english there and. I moved around to different parts of greece and really had a great time. I think. Just having my group of friends that i met there and going through the experience with them. I think one of my most memorable experiences was going to elephantiasis in a car with everybody and having a just a fantastic time. Yes it was. I think i'm shy to begin with and and dad's i get to know people that i'm much more outgoing. Photography in language studies. I know it's not hawaii. What are you doing. How much is stay-at-home maybe watch a movie. Rest in bed. Watching a movie in bed that's probably one of the things i like to do to relax. How are you at controlling. I think very good. When was the. It was probably with my boyfriend. Regarding money issues. What's something you feel guilty. I need to. I feel guilty about not generating as much income as i need to right now. Tell me about. I'm having some struggles in my career right now. And financially to becoming very difficult. Add husband's been difficult. But i've been working very hard to to remedy that. So well i'm here and them i'm doing this this focus study i'm doing it many things to generate more money working harder but looking for other ways to generate money outside of my my career. Probably being raped. No. Sometimes. Not that i'm aware of. I've been feeling stressed. I've been feeling. Been feeling stressed and worried. I don't seem to have any problem with it may seem to get a good night sleep almost every night. I'm grumpy and and lethargic and in the morning. Situation i wish i would have handled differently. I really can't think of one right now. The hardest decision i've ever had to make. Was probably. Deciding to not have the child. Can you tell me about. Well i was pregnant. And. Wasn't sure whether or not i should continue the pregnancy. And that was also due to financial burden and. The father was involved with did not want the child so i made that very very difficult decision. Really really happy. I know when i went to cancun on a holiday over the new year new year. your holiday. I felt absolutely fantastic i felt. Happy i felt relaxed. I felt like i didn't have a care in the world to temporarily. Free. What are some things you wish. I wish i could. Be a little bit stronger and more assertive. Definitely more assertive. I would say i'm a wonderful wonderful friend. I when i left somebody you know i love them very deeply friends family. Boyfriend so i think that's good i'm very loyal as a friend. I'm honest i care about people. I'm fun to be with so i think those are some of my best qualities. Tell me about your relationship. My relationship with my family with my father is not so great. My parents were divorced when i was young and he's sort of been in and out of my life you know forever. I'm mostly out. So that's it. It's not fantastic but but it's something that i'm used to so it's not. As painful as it would be a patty been there and then i lost him but it's it's still it's still. It's still not the best situation i mean i still wish that could be. Remedied somehow. There's good and bad relationships in my family. Someone that's been there for me since i was very very young. And is always been just incredible when i love her so much. 10 or 20 years ago. I would have told myself to work harder than and not have so much fun so i don't have to work so hard now. Is there anything you regret. A gay regret exactly that i regret i'm not taking my career seriously earlier on. I'm because now it's b been. It's been much harder. I think it was taking the kids to the pier. And spending some wonderful time with them. And making them happy. That was probably a great time i'm one of the best times in the last few weeks. And. And they're they're great kids. No i think they're there it's challenging. It is more difficult because they're stepchildren so there are some. Times when i'm not sure exactly how much to get involved and how much not to get involved. But we're very lucky because they are really good kids they do tend to fight a lot. But. But i bet it's not as difficult as i think some other parents have it. What are some ways that you. I made it make a make a conscious effort. Not to not to punish them or over punish them. I make a conscious decision. Not to scream at them the way that i was screaming that i was screaming at a lot as a child. And it was really it was really difficult so i make sure not to do that. I think i'm most proud of. The fact that i have been able to. Travel the world. And living other places many many other places. Find the country and around the world. And. The fact that i learned several languages. And that's what i've been able to maintain. Really long long long relationships with my friends. Thank you. Goodbye goodbye. Post survey for you to fill out about your experience and. \n",
      "Thank you. Yes i am. I'm good thank you. Originally from los angeles and my parents are from central america. Yes. The weather i like that i can get to the water if i want to to the hills or hike or just any element that want to get to i can get you. Traffic busyness everybody's always in a hurry. That's about it. When i can i have family in central america and when i can my husband die we try to. Go to warm places like mexico or somewhere in the caribbean. The freedom of not having to have my daily routine and not be guilty about not doing something i said i would do if i'm at home and if i'm too far away from home to do it then i don't have anything to worry about. Recently i went to honduras again that's where my family is from. So it's more like a saddle for when i get to see my family but also kind of get to be away from home. So i do it by not imposing on them i visit them but i stay in a hotel so that way i can still kind of have my freedom and not feel like i'm obligated to being with them so it's more fun that way. Experiences on vacation or. Terrible experience. Probably hawaii in lahaina and just having enough food i'm a foodie so having the pig roasted underground and just eating it that way it's just i've never been able to taste it that way anytime el so it's like a very memory is a deep memory for me cuz. No matter what i do to my pork it'll never taste like that parking lot hina. Business and that was years ago so i ended up in the marketing field. So i've enjoyed that my business background did help me get in the marketing field. My dream job. Well i guess i would have to do is food i love to cook. And only reason i hesitated because. I love to cook but i just do it for home and friends and family if i were to turn into if it would have turned into a job i feel as if it was just not be as joyous or i wouldn't have as much fun as i do have it you know what i have now. But if i could just do it as a job and still have the fun and the joy that i have in cooking everyday now then that would be my dream job. I'm outgoing. Depends on where i'm at if i'm where i'm at actually the first thing i do is just kind of get ahold of myself that way i'm always in control no matter where i'm standing at and always say that i am my own peace pa peace so i just kind of just take a deep breath assess my situation. Figure out what i can control what i can control and then proceed from there but just so just kind of. Breathing get ahold of myself first. I'm actually very good i'm actually very mild temper to begin with. I don't really let anything agitate me. And so if i do feel myself just getting hot or if i just react i just would have just like i said just do my own little self check you know i'm out of customer went off for a second but i do my own little self check and just so you know what come on now it's not worth it. Be who you are and just stay there. Introducing my husband and we were going back and forth about my relationship with my father and i was trying to get a point across to him and he was just kind of overlooking my feelings in it and i was i didn't want him to overlook my feelings and act as if i wasn't feeling the way i was feeling so i kept stressing my point in different ways and i found myself now in a debate and then that's when i pull back and said no it look babe this is how i feel about it i'm not asking you to make me feel any differently i'm just asking you to acknowledge my feelings. When i got to my own conclusion i felt triumphant because. The point of the argument in my mind was to clarify how i felt not for him to impose his you know he's very macho kind of manly guy i don't want him to just overshadow my feelings with his logic and so i said no as long as i feel better because i understood it hurt. Saying. I get my son comes to mind he's 22 years old. And he we have a very strange relationship right now and it's okay i'm okay with it he's used to be being a little bit more needy so he i think he assumed. That i would just always look couldn't go looking for him or call for him as opposed to waiting for him to call me. And i think. I may be a very weird answer but i wish early on in my life as his mother i would have kind of adjusted that so that he wouldn't be so comfortable waiting for me to be the one to come and check on him he doesn't live with me he has his own place. But waiting for me to be the one to come and look for him and you know try to make sure that he's okay i think it's probably way more than you met but i would have done that differently i would have murdered him differently along the way and released him at an earlier age meeting that i would have treated him. More of an adult and then also not expected him to just kind of you know. I would have killed the expectation in him for me to contours in him. If that makes sense. No it's not easy you have to sacrifice and beyond just physical things you have to just make sure you put your kids. Needs ahead of your own and. I guess the second part of that answer is that it is easy once you realize that as long as you're okay you're okay so. My son and my daughter they both know i love them unconditionally. So my parenting has become easier the more and more i've lived in that truth where i'm not expecting anything from them but then i also not expecting any disrespect. As long as we have that clear line of communication whatever else is going on falls under that category respect. Seeing them maybe make decisions that i wish they wouldn't make it could be as simple as an outfit no choice or as much as a career change but having to sit back and watch them listen to be open and then just. Kind of just be there in about they want to talk about it but then not also also trying not to manage them because i was also their age and have to remember that i didn't want to be managed and even if i made a mistake i don't want to be judged. So the difficult part is watching them go through the process on their own and just sort of kind of just waiting around and luckily something major with my kids but whatever that personal downfall is just kind of being there and not having and i told you i told you so spirit on me. Just fulfilling knowing that you know i created this and i like plan both my kids so it's just it's a real. It's an honor that i was able to do it as an honor that they're healthy. And it's fun watching them sort of just kind of grow into their own. And it's like they're minimis but then they're also different than i am and so is fine just. Being able to allow them be who they are and just celebrate them as they are so i'm enjoying that. Wow completely my parents immigrated here from central america in the 60s i was born the year after they got here. So they're their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the american lifestyle and which was not a bad thing it's just that their parenting style was more about making sure we had a home making sure. We had the shelter of course and food and clothes and schooling but there was not really a lot of time spent on the relationship from my mother to daughter to me as a daughter or my father to me as a daughter so i had to kind of figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent. Divorcing my first husband cuz i was going to be the one that toppled that whole situation he was a good father just not a good husband to me and after twenty years i knew that i was going to be the one to say this is not working for me anymore and since i did that a domino effect was it happened. And then i just made some decisions to where i didn't want to go through so much court hassle so i just. Did it tina turner and said just give you my name you keep everything else so it was a very hard decision by way of how it affected my kids that's all i cared about in terms of losing everything physical and and all the material stuff i could care less but it was hard because i knew was going to affect my kids and they were the only thing i was concerned about. My husband and i did not you know see eye-to-eye on certain things united regarding our marriage heat i didn't feel validated as a woman or as a wife and that's just who i am and was with a very areas at. He didn't validate me and he just kind of saw me as a partner who was helping fund his extracurriculars where there was just travel or or whatever the case maybe i'm not here to talk about that part of it. Bottom line is that whatever he was doing was outside of you know the sanctity of our home and i was tired of just you know working and and benefiting from everything but then not being fulfilled as a woman or a wife and he wasn't her credit changed despite all the counseling went through. And i thought well this is not working for me and i have to take care of myself first and i had low self-esteem i mean i wasn't perfect i had a lot of things going on with myself and i had to learn how to love myself in order to in order for me to love my children and then in order for me to get the dog that i should get in return. You know what is actually pretty easy because of the end of the day i just you know good bad ugly or indifferent whatever mistakes i'm happy that day or whatever great thing went on that day. My goal in life is to have peace of mind so when i put my head down at night. I i just asked myself that you know did i do anything that i'm ashamed of today that i cross anybody that i not do you know and i'm not being sanctimonious or acting as if i'm pollyanna but i believe in karma i'm a god-fearing woman so i just want to make sure that i did everything i'm supposed to do today and if there's something i can rectify it you know i just make it a point to promise to myself go back and rectified or at least learn from that and just not make that same mistake in another day. Really good light you don't have to rough patches with the family individually like i said with my son my daughter the teenagers so she's kind of coming into her own so that's a different relationship just opposite of me i'm actually very easy-going very bohemian style is very social very it all just out there so i'm having to just kind of find our balance. But overall it's just i won't complain i'm very happy for a very simplistic lifestyle that i just kind of foster on my own everyday and i just enjoy my little. Many accomplishments whether anyone sees them or not. No i haven't thank god. No. Really happy to see. I said home and i think it was when. Different things running through my head. I think with my daughter and i my teenage daughter and i came to understand understanding on. Our mother-daughter relationship i'm not trying to be her best friend but yeah that doesn't mean you can't talk to me. And i think when she came to me the other day just kind of gave me a big hug from behind me. Without really saying anything i really felt her just accepting herself and she accepted the fact that i accept who she is as she is so was a very. Teen moment only she and i kind of knew about it but it just gave me just a happiness it nothing else could ever give me. Thank you. I'm easy going i'm fine i'm just very. You know. Chameleon comes to mind i just kind of acclimate to with whatever situation i'm in i'm very honest and very real and just you know if i have to be. I'm just very adult i'm an adult woman and you know they would just destroy my best friend would describe me as someone that she can rely on extremely reliable i do as i say i say what i do. And i just you know i don't. I'll deal with bs. A change about myself. Probably cosmetic things maybe ye'll adjust. Let me think what. What are some things i would change about. Sounds weird that i was saying nothing nothing really. I think i would just be. A little bit more aware of others i think i'm super sensitive to others but i think i would just be more aware make sure that i'm not being selfish or i'm not doing anyone i'll just because i want to get through my yoga i want to do something else i think i would just be more observant and aware of those around me to make sure i'm not offending anybody. I don't have any regrets that i think about that all the time and you know this is natural to go back and say if i were in that situation with the mindset i have now what would i do but the reality is that i know that everything that has happened up to this point is shaped me so i can't you know very well take the benefit from it and then turn around and call it a regret. Because i know i learned from it probably sounds very textbook but that's true that is really how i live so i believe that everything good bad or indifferent happen for a reason and my job is to take from it. What i'm supposed to take from it and take that into my future so i'm to take the you know the hard knocks with it with the joys. Be real with myself that's that's one thing that took me twenty years to kind of get to just to kind of be honest with myself to embrace who i am. So just you know get to know who i am learn my own infrastructure. Be comfortable with the with the innate things that are apart of me. Don't try to read. Lottery that myself or try to become something that i'm not. I would have still chosen the same marketing career to see i would have still climb the same corporate ladders. But i would have done it from a more internal place not that i lost myself in it. But when in terms of my family life i would have just been more true to myself and that way i wouldn't have had any kind of resentments. My family my my role as a wife my role as a mother i think that ultimately that's where my main fulfillment comes from because no matter what at the end of this life this life of in this body and this is leased vehicle that i'm in i'm going to do or i'm going to be as an epitaph somewhere in a cemetery. And i'm always just. True that i mean i've been always true to that from the time i was eighteen and realize i wanted to be married and have a. Family and kids and all that. I think that ultimately that that's where my true fulfillment comes from. Thank you. School. That's cool. Okie doke. \n",
      "Yes. Alright. Where are you from originally. Los angeles california. The lights big city. It's always something going on. What are some things. The traffic and that's it. Business administration and business management. Not that about something else i'm doing networking at the moment. To open up a bit calling line and just supply the whole world with clothing. Yeah. Definitely. Come all about myself. It's all about me. Not often but more times than not yeah. Being lied to and i guess. And people think you're dumber than. Do anything with you are. Try to get away from everything going to my own space. Very well i'm great at controlling my temper. Probably like 2 days ago probably just over some sports it wasn't a real argument. Not a lot but i travel enough. Just being able to secure a change-of-pace see somebody knows he new faces new environment. Let me see the last trip i had was. Vegas you know how vegas cuz it was pretty fun. Gelato lot of drinking and a lot of partying going on. Pretty open-minded i'm kind pretty much everybody on. Pretty even kill guy. It's alright give me better. No. No ma'am. Nope. No. Lately it's been. Pretty tough i guess cuz i've been staying up so late but. That's my fault. I don't know i guess i'm a night owl all of a sudden i'm turning into an hour. Sluggish and tired all day if i don't sleep well. Goddamn just laying around. Have you noticed that. No not too much. Stay focused and listen to the adults. Yeah. Self-explanatory i could have just listened to. Parents are other adults i tried to steer you in the right way in. You know you're being a stubborn kid at that at those ages so it's like. What are you talkin about i miss my life i can do what i want and i could listen to you. But now i see that. Whether to tell him you was correct. Hilarious. Pretty close. Both my parents mother and father. Recently how did i do. New year's eve party i had thought i had the time of my life it was so fun. This new year's eve i went to a party at friend's house in baldwin hills area. He had it at a pretty nice house it's a three-story house and it was like. 350 people in there. It was. Pretty fine but it was. Also not that fun because it was so many people and you can really move so. That was the only downfall of the size that i brought my new year in. Great with tons of friends and. That's how supposed to be done. I'm generally in a good mood everyday i mean. Waking up with me in a good mood i guess you can say that but. A good a good meal. One of my most memorable experiences are probably. When i was younger i was in boy scouts and we should go camping all the time and one year we went to. Yellowstone or yosemite one of those spices and we had to work on a mountain biking merit badge and. Of course man from the city of mesa mountain biking i can ride a mountain bike but. Once we got in the real mountains on got on real mountain bikes i gained a new respect for the mountain bikers it was pretty it was fun and pretty intense going downhill doing about. 45 miles an hour in dirt on a bicycle was pretty intense. I'll i'll never forget that. I don't know that's a tough one of my most proud of. I don't know honestly. \n",
      "Important i wonder if people really like understand it you know what i mean like a people do judge yeah. Bizarre. And i did like the ricki lake show with my friend and i saw myself itv oh my god yeah but i was speeding i was i was eating candy dots gone. It's like that. And then i was looking at ricki lake like there must be some around my eyes cuz i was like she was like right there i don't know. It's so i had to actually like act you know i'm in the audience but i have to like pretend like i was interested in what you have to say but it looks so second looking at her like that like there's something wrong my eyes. No i just thought i was in a doctor's office and they had it on and like god it was funny cuz there's these guys like winking at me on the way out like that celebrity audience it in there it's like i hated every minute of it but we got sewing machines free sewing machines $200 worth it but i was so embarrassed.

I'm good. I don't really have a temper. I was my ex-husband about money. People lying. Cheating conniving. Drug addicts. You know just ugly people people that are. Hideous. Any inside you know. Jesus christ that's about it. My mother when she was. Alive what she still owes. Positive influence but. Nobody really. Jesus. I can't really think of one right now. Gosh. All i guess like maybe modeling that was pretty cool. Yeah. I was just. Kind of. Sarah like to see yourself in magazines and pictures and stuff you know. I didn't understand how it could have been me but. Then my photographer told me he was like well someone has to do to muscle to you so well and it's true. So that was cool. Just kind of fell into it by accident. I've always. Yeah yeah. I wish i did it i took it further. But. I couldn't. Really happy. I don't remember. I really don't. I really have a best friend but i'm sure. Anybody would describe me as outgoing. No. Yes. I was sad 1984. I couldn't deal with it. Had to see a psychiatrist. Horrified couldn't sleep. Panicked. Major anxiety. Oh yeah. Yes. Yes i do. It could be if you see the right doctor. It gives you the opportunity to talk to somebody. Hopefully they can give you answers most of them don't they try to find the answers and. Side of you. Get it out of you but. Just good to be able to talk to somebody that's. Tobias neutral. Really depressed. Extremely depressed. Poverty. Yeah. Yeah. I'm a lot more tired i sleep longer. And. I am. I just don't have the drive motivation that i did before. Just try to be strong. Just have to get through it. Yes. Not really. I'm an open book. Well. I would say perfectionist that's not really good quality cuz i can get. Dangerous. I'm just. Artistic i'm good at a lot of things. Really good at a lot of things. But. Well i'm good i'm a good hairdresser makeup artist. I crocheting it really well make jewelry. Not good with computers or phones though electronics. Yeah. A perfect house. Orwell what i'm not depressed like this i was a perfect wife. The perfect wife. Yeah. But not anymore. Cuz i'm divorced now. But it wasn't me. It was him. He was on drugs. So he chose the drugs. We're tipis problems. Yeah does. It's really hard. Because it's like the drugs are his mistress. Who. Yes. Now. Well i don't really consider myself an introvert. Yeah. I've a lot of. Regrets but there really wasn't anything i could do about it. So there's really no. Point in regretting it. You do what you do and you make a decision and then. It's already done so why i regret it why bother. Make sure that when you marry a man. That you asked him if he does drugs or alcohol. That's one for sure. That was the only question i didn't answer ask i. I didn't know. First lot of things. A lot of stuff. Just the things that i can do. That my talents that's it. Well. I can have my starbucks. And. My orange gina i drink orange gina everyday i smoke cigarettes and fortunately but. It's good to have those because. You know i'm addicted to them. And then if i can. It's something really. Good healthy at night time. And. But i will basically if i have something to do. If i have a goal. A somewhere to go something to do like today even. Let's meet a good man. Yeah otherwise. I'd be afraid that i'd stay home and just lay in bed or perform all day i could form 48 hours. Hornbill. Yeah. You're welcome nice to meet you. So i pressed the button. You're good. She's good except for you know it's like the one i could she hurt me by the way the one i always come is weird distracting other than. Yeah the one. Yeah she kind of made a mistake on one part. \n",
      "Thanks. Hi. Yes. Okay. Where you from. From santa monica. Other people. Mostly. Where the people are. I'm not much of a. You travel a lot. I know not a lot. I can't afford to travel as much as i'd like to. I was an english major. I just like reading a lot at the time so. It sounds like the best thing well the most fun thing to study. No not anymore. I love my job. You could almost say. Virtually. It's my dream job would be to. Manager soccer club. Always be pretty much impossible for me. I don't have any experience in that field. Very shy. Sometimes when i'm feeling 10. I can honestly. I know it's not hawaii. And i play music. What i do when i'm annoyed. I don't know. I do what i'm annoyed. I can't think of anything i don't know. I don't think yeah i don't do anything specifically. I pretty good i would say very good i don't lose my temper very often. I was the last time i argued with someone. I can't remember. I don't have a lot of conflicts with people i can't remember the last time i argued with someone. Tell me about nevada. Well it see when i was. A little kid. I was outside my grandparents restaurant. And there was a robbery and i saw it i was i saw it when when the robbers were leaving. That maybe i would want to erase that from my memory if i could. Well i didn't know what was happening in that moment so i didn't feel. So bad at the time but i felt better afterward because then. Yeah my mother was upset by my mother was there and she had to call the police and it was. It was disturbing to see her. Really disturb that way but. At the time that it actually happened i wasn't really upset it was more the aftermath of it. Situation that. I don't know. There's probably a million situations that i would have i would have handled differently i can't think of one in particular. Maybe. I think that when i was a kid. Well i think that when i was at sea. Well i have okay have a good one. I didn't marry the girl that i think that i should have married. So. That's a big one for me. Tell me about that. Yeah well. What we were together for about 4 years. And i think i just took it for granted and i just didn't commit. And. That was a long time ago and now that it's been so many years i realized well i don't know they fights realization but i think now that. That yes she should have been my wife that we were. Meant for each other are made for each other. But because. My selfishness and because i just. Have this fear of commitment of the time i just felt like i didn't. They didn't do what i should have done with with a smart thing would have been. What's something you feel guilty. Well the last thing i can think of that i would say it feel guilty about was. No i feel a lot of guilt about my my friendships i'm not i don't feel like i'm as good of a friend. As i could be but then at the same time i don't really know exactly what the. How i could be a better friend i just feel a little guilty that i'm not. I can't help people anyone who has a problem like ants. I don't feel like i can help anyone. Who i know who has a problem. That happens every day i guess it happens with everyone who i know and everyone. All of my relatives and all of my friends i don't. Feel like i can really give them anything or help them in their lives. Tell me about your relationship with. Well there. It's very distant it's it's just. It's very cordial and it's very. I don't know what the word it is haunted. It's kept it a very surface-level i don't think that they'd know i don't think that my family really knows me very well at all. And i don't know them very well either not nothing i didn't true sense. So. Yeah it's. I think a lot of families are that way but it is. Does bother me that mine is that way. How is he. Always very easy i sleep a lot and i am. Yeah i have no problem sleeping at all. Easier. No not really i would say. The way i'm now it's the way i think i've been my whole life. So. You done that when i was a little kid i slept a lot also and. No i don't think i. I've changed much. I'm pretty down. But like i said. In a way i could tell you i'm feeling really down but then again. I've always been this way so. It's hard to say that it's down on its. Consistently that way. Yes. Hello. I would long time ago i was. About 10 years old. Around there about. I was just missing a lot of school. I didn't want to go to school so we eventually they sent me to. To a therapist and then to a psychologist and then to a psychiatrist and it went from there. No i haven't gone to therapy. Since i was a teenager. Well. I didn't feel it was helping me at all. So. One day i just. Decided i didn't want to go anymore. Well like i said it i didn't feel that it helped me. So i guess it's not enough that it effectively much. No i wouldn't say. Disturbing now. The last time. Well i feel pretty happy whenever i see my nephew. And i have a. My best friend's children are feel like they're mine my nephew and my niece and i'm pretty happy when i'm around them. My ideal weekend would be. I would probably be traveling i would. Really enjoyed getting out of the city every weekend. It going anywhere really just anywhere out of the city. I just seen the way different people live and how people are different wherever you go i really do think people are different when you can go to different places and. How they interact with you and how they see the world. Different food. And i also like historical places i'm into history and i and i enjoy this visiting anywhere that has some sort of. Historical significance. I haven't taken a trip in a long time. The last trip i really took was i went to france a few years ago for a wedding. And i had a really good time there i had always wanted to go to paris and so i got to go to paris and then i went to a little town. It's a few hours away from paris where the actual wedding was. I knew it was really fun i think that the church where the wedding was was thousand years old so. That was a really cool trip. Like i don't know i don't know i don't know what's what. Would be considered memorable. America will experience. Probably the most memorable experience i guess which is be. Nothing in particular but but living with a girl who i just i told you earlier that i think now. But we should have. Cousin married. That's something that stays in my memory that's why i'm saying it's memorable because. It's it's still with me in the. It's something that i don't think you know what i know i'll never forget. But it's not an eu. Particular day or any particular moment. What are some things you wish you could change about. A lot. Check would be healthier. For one thing i'm more energetic. Panda. More friendly i think i am pretty friendly. But more more outgoing moore's more more social. Those two things mainly i guess i would like to be more and more social more enthusiastic and more. And healthier. How your best friend is. That's a good question my best friend how would my best friend describe me i think. I think he would say that i am. A very cheesy but very spiritual person. And that i am very giving i think i'm a lot more selfish than people think i am but people think that i'm not selfish. And probably he would say that i'm creatables. Hold my advice to to myself. I don't understand the question. Yeah but we already talked about it. What are you most proud. No i can't. I don't think i really believed in and being proud or an in pride. I don't think accomplishments are really something to be proud of but i can't really think of. Any accomplishments. Anyway even if i did have something to be proud of that i can think of any any sort of accomplishment i've had. Something i did recently that i really enjoyed. Well i signed karaoke with a couple of friends of mine. I don't usually do that but. Yeah. That was a lot of fun. A few days ago. Thank you. I was more difficult than i thought it was going to be just kind of had me stumped a lot and a lot of the time and i was. I think i got better. After a little while and i was yeah. At first i thought i was going to get mad because i'm not saying anything and i don't know how to answer and. \n",
      "Okay. Yes. I'm doing pretty well. I have some stressful circumstances going on but. Right now i'm i'm engaged. I'm from minnesota. I 31 years ago. Half my life. Frequently i've been back there quite a bit. But over the years not not that often. Well it's a whole different experience and i got to go back there to see my my family and then old friends and. So it's sent. Hilarious. It's home it's nice to return here. To be an actor. I'm just actually getting around to it. Was in another business for. 25 years and. Now finally i can't put it off anymore.

Wow just the other night i was. Performing in a nightclub in. Had an opportunity to introduce myself to a. A very famous person and i. I didn't do it. I'm not sure i guess. I didn't know if it would be appropriate to approach him. I can't think of. I can't think of one. Well. I've been married for abby. 24 years in july. Which is a couple of months and. My wife and i have not been sleeping in the same bed for about 3 years. And. But we have a. A very high-achieving daughter who's going to graduate from high school. The spring and she's just. Gotten an accepted at a college. But she. Wants to go to with a very nice scholarship. Yeah she will. My daughter's been very. Low-maintenance for me mom props more so for my wife but she's always been an excellent. Child. Well we're more similar i think been different but i'm much more. Aware of. What's happening in the world than then much more informed than my parents were. But that is in terms of child-rearing i think. We're all we've all been kind of hands off. And i'm. My wife has been more hands-on. Well the financial responsibility. Wanting to. Make sure that your child has everything that. Her. 1/2 +. Not wanting her to go. Not have the same. As her friends. And chives. Very wealthy friend so it said some. I'm not a.m.. A gifted money maker. Set alarm. It's a struggle but still we we we keep on keep up. Oh. Couple of different. At one preacher. Who's church i attended for about 20 years until he died. Was very influential and also another. Spiritual guru. That. Turtle. Put me on a path to breaking patterns of behavior that. We're kind of dictated by my upbringing. Oh just. Bob instead of. Working for somebody else being able to. Start a business in indian business for yourself in and 2. No not be dependent on. Just one source of income. Meeting one particular woman when i first got out here. She left me less than healthy. Physically. Well i. I self-medicate to go to sleep which i probably don't have to do but i. About half the night sight i wake up. Much earlier than i would like to. Oh you should mostly to have to go to the bathroom. Wow i do pretty well at night guess i'm just not quite as functional as i'd like to be. There are a couple of nights a week when i work until. 2 a.m. in the morning and don't get to bed until 3 and in the night. Normally if i i need seven hours if i only get 5 or 6 and then sluggish and. Very anxious. Well. I have. Big gum. I've bills to pay and not a lot of income coming in. Yeah it's some cuz i don't like to. Far behind i'm. I feel like i'm. Worried about losing ground and. Steak serve. Are high and. So. It's an uncomfortable position. No. I am a classic. Depressive. And. Yeah i guess i have i guess i have my side to see a therapist and. Do i. Therapist i'm seeing now is not trying to prescribe drugs. Or medications. Previous ones have. Probably. 6 years ago. By my wife trying to push me into it she thought. It was a way of. I think getting help finding work. And i'm. It's. Not it said it's just. Enjoyed guy having someone to talk to. Not really. Oh. Fifth. Kind of. Not wanting to. Face the day and wanting to. This time nfl weariness with the struggle. And. Justin. Displeasure with my life. Yes. They're what. I don't understand that word. Oh. It's. Something i look forward to because. Hi i feel like. Talking to someone who understands me. Hi i can't i don't know. He's little. Acting gig that i get makes me. Happy birthday. I'm just mildly happy and usually turn out to be disappointing experiences and. I never. Over. Excited. What happiness. Well yesterday and i made a dessert to celebrate my daughters. Scholarship. And. It was delicious and then we really enjoyed.. No. Comedian that one woman. Probably. Try a little harder. It had started this business. Around that time. And. It was it was some just it was difficult but we were successful at it and. I guess i could have gotten it. Rolling even more. So that it wouldn't be so. Dead today. Oh. Getting out of town. Going. Going away when i when which is rarely. Possible. Well my daughter is a great source of pride and. Attracted. Ben. Pretty successful in my endeavors. And now i'm just. Going for the the big. The big e. Apple. Annum. And i hope to be successful there too. Okay. You're welcome. Goodbye. Experian. \n",
      "Okay. Yes. I'm doing pretty good. I was born and raised right here in los angeles. The weather. Would be number one i also like the diverse. Cultures. I like the fact that there's a lot of different things here you can do and it's a lot of opportunity here. Not just for myself before my kids and i think it's really a great place to be when you're trying to establish a career go to school. Learn about different people. The traffic the cost-of-living sometimes i think it's. Too big. And i think the transportation system as far as the bus and train. Is long overdue they need to revamp it or. You know add more buses and things like that just make it easier for people to get around on public transportation. I trolled when i can a little bit here and there i have not been overseas yet which is a goal of mine within the next couple of years so i've just travel domestically i try to take at least one trip a year somewhere. I just like the fact of getting on the plane and going places. I'm going to take me somewhere i've never been. And learning about that place you know like so if i'm going to dc i really look forward to it cuz it's the historic city. You know things like that. My most recent trip would have been dc his last year i went to go visit a friend and i stayed about. Fifth effing 3 to 4 days and they got to see the capitol. He showed me around showed me although you know historic landmarks insights the white house the capitol building i got to see a lot of other different government buildings and it was it was a good experience the irony was i had to fly on 9/11 and so that had me a little and easy but once i was in the plane up-in-the-air i was okay and it was all good and once i was back home also i guess. But i i missed the trip and i look forward to going back. Attending my friend's wedding she had a destination wedding in hawaii. Actually maui that was actually 23 3 years ago 3 years ago. And all i guess and i've been trying to get back ever since and i want to take my kids and i just love it there and actually come look forward to to moving there one day. I have three sons thirteen-year-old twins boys and my youngest is also boy he's eight. They all have birthdays in june the twins are june 9th in. My baby is june 4th and tell her just a few days apart but. 5 years apart technically. Allergist. Super super. Typical boys active all-over plays hormones puberty is action interesting time because you know the two older boys are going through puberty. Their teenage years. My youngest. Still trying to figure some things out for himself you know doing that transition stage of 8 to 9 years old. They'll be nine in june and then my oldest of e14. So it's a challenging time for me as well. Just the joy of watching what you put into being a parent everyday and seeing how. Just with love and nurturing and. The right you know i can't take proper development but just with. You know love and nurturing how a baby grows into a toddler into you know a young boy to a teenager and an italian man is so that experience alone has been rewarding just watching my sons grow up and go through these different stages and see how they have developed and you know. Seeing some of the things that they're going through now that's so reminiscent of my teenage years. And dumb it's just it's very rewarding and i actually look forward to maybe even being a foster parent later down the line when they're older and often college cuz i really love children you giving back. It's probably a couple things but i would just say. From me being a single parent is the financial well i would say that along with some of the emotional with them having. To bear the brunt of the responsibility of just chow. Child rearing. You know the. Just the everyday things so. But you have to deal with the. Sometimes when you just tired you don't want to be bothered or you're trying to do things for yourself you have to be reminded that all day i got to cook or had to go pick my son up for i have to take him to baseball practice this one wants to go from here. This one is acting moody and you know just so those types of challenges that's what was the financial and you know making sure you know you're able to put food on the table you're paying your rent and you know you keeping up with the day today and that's. Those two are probably the hardest things for me to deal with. Well i just some take it day-by-day i just put one foot in front of the other and. I'm extremely spiritual so i just rely on god and. Pray a lot meditate. If i see a need a little help with. You know i'm not above asking for help sell sometimes if i have to reach out to people or. You know see what other resources are out there to help me you don't try to do that and so for me right now my biggest challenge is just. Try to go back to school to put myself in a better. Economic situation so i can continue to provide for them comfortably. I studied communications actually i was a journalism public relations major with a minor in sociology. And. Now i'm studying business. I just thought that you know. There would be more opportunities for me with business. As far as. Jobs. Then i you don't have a desire to go to graduate school. So i just figured in the long run it was a better. It will put me in a better position give me more opportunities. With the communications it's a little limited in association get older the fields of tv reporting and things like that. Arcana. Because you know harder to obtain. So i just thought i would go into something more realistic. And. You know but i like both bills are really do i like communicating riding reading talkin as you can tell and tell. So we'll see. A couple probably but i would say ultimately would be traveling like working as like a travel writer going to different destinations. Trying different foods out writing about different people. Cultures. Learning in living you know about those different people and cultures living amongst us. You know the. The people there in. Being interactive with the children that stuff like that so i kind of hope to be able to do that one day but yes. It would be something along those lines and then the fallback will be the counselor social worker something in that area if i could encompass all three hopefully i can. Like to do that. That's a hard question probably because i initially grew up very shy. In the not so much shocked as i am reserve now. But i can saturday but just reserved and you know what i go somewhere. Checking everything everybody else out. And then once i become comfortable or i can wait till situation then i'm like okay you know i warm up to the to the situation of the people but i'm also friendly i can be very friendly and outgoing you like to talk. You know. I seem like a chatterbox but i'm not really. So usually if i'm in a big space with the whole lot of people i don't like to be the center of attention i can attach myself to one or two people and. You know become friendly with them but ii overall i am open friendly person. For me i could be something as simple as just. Unplugging. Everything all electronics and just sitting for a few moments. Meditating. Praying or reading a good spiritual scripture. If i'm able to i like to go for a good massage. Maybe get a facial. Adult things that will. I like i like the physical part part of a like massages things that really release tension. And if not then just like i said just sitting at home reading and praying or. I like the beach i love the beach so sometimes i driving. Go sit by the beach. I'll also like to just maybe go and have lunch by myself or get a mani-pedi or maybe go window shopping you know things like that. Pretty good sometimes i'm just like i don't really have such an issue with the temper. As i am i just a more impatient. Unfortunately a lot of times with people you know situation. So i just can become really irritated or irritable. Quiet detated especially if it's that time of the month for me and just lose patients outside of that. I'm actually pretty good i try to be very you know conscious of where i'm at and. Be very patient with people especially if i can see that the person is like if there's a new check out person at the the counter or cashier i do try to be a do try to be patient and understanding cuz i would want that you know if it were me i would want someone to explain that to me. You know what my kids sometimes you know it's to save our 12 ways to lymphocyte time of the month i'm just just leave me alone. Or might have a short temper or short fuse. So i am conscious of it i try to be. Aware of it and try to monitor it but you know like anybody i'm human and their times are i have my days are moment when i could just like that go off and. Just lose it. Well i really hated not pressing an argument but there's been an ongoing pain with american express so i would say. Because it was not a personal. Contact with a company. It really was an argument but you know that i had some issues with american express had to call in about a laughing saturday and i'll tell i wasn't getting the response i expected and tablet the whole contact the call was just back and forth. Very frustrating and i was upset and. You know the rap was trying to over talk me then i'll talk her so you know i don't know if you would consider that an argument but i would definitely say that's the last time when you know. Adjust. I like reached my boiling point. To say the least and was really upset and. That i was the closest you know to an argument and then had to call back this morning that would be really escalating argument but it was a tense exchange for a minute or two. Probably the most recent contact and that would have been the one on saturday with american express. Or actually was on sunday. Yeah and i know the person was trying to help me but you know when you're constantly being told different things and i've had to call in about five or six times about the same situation. It is not be resolved it just takes you there so. Just are kept raising my boys. Sesen things i shouldn't have. And just was more so allowed myself to lose control of the contact i like to really feeling controller contact. And so it just took me there my blood pressure was raised excuse me and i was just kind of a mess for a while for like maybe 30 minutes or an hour after that just irritable and agitated and upset and as far as always try to you know. Go back in. Pull from those in. You know. Do my own. Sense of feedback and. See how i can you don't handle things differently but that's one up i definitely wish i could have kept my cool and been more level-headed and and not really raise my voice and you know been more polite. Probably have had a couple but probably stamos is a situation years ago when i just had my sons and they probably by twins they were probably about 2. And i was in a situation with their father again and became pregnant and. It just was not a good time. And he. Pretty but she do was not comfortable with me having another child at the time. Until i wasn't comfortable. Had another child either but wanted to keep the baby but. You put me under so much stress and. You look kind of want to say. Really push me into having terminating the pregnancy. And that's always stayed with me and i've always. Miss that pregnancy that child i think about. That that baby or what could have been i try not to hold any anger or resentment towards him or anybody about it but i know deep down inside secretly if i had it to do all over again i would have just i would have kept the baby and move forward so that would have been. Polizzi heart especially emotionally like a deal with a lot and i have dealt with a lot. You know. Been unemployed or. You know lot of financial problems but that to me was the hardest. Thank you. Though. No. Okay you know. I was laid off in december. So i've been constantly try to do things to you know get back on my feet so that's been a little tough ipad to face a lot of challenges. Dealing with thad and issues with child support and. Try to find another job and going back to school. So my range of emotions have just have been just that arranged and a very good friend of mine now. Who we both started off on the same place. About 5 years ago well she's been able to move forward and. I'm going with her life now she's graduating in next month from usc with her masters in social work so i'm feeling a little envious of that and i have been for like the past year but more so recently although i'm very very happy for her you know and she's a good person and she deserves it but of course you don't got it when she was me so that was kind of been bothering me. Well i'm really good with them people i communicate well i like to talk really good with children. That's why we like to teacher via counselor. Although i have it not really tapped into it i know i'm a very creative person. I know i write pretty good i could possibly be a creative writer but i know i'm very creative so. If given the opportunity i know i could tap into that and really develop those skills something like with maybe songwriting. Fiction writing. Probably like interior decorating. Anything artistic just anything cuz i love musical of arts i love drama love plays. Lubbock fashion buff but i do love fashion and makeup and stuff like that so. I think those with our are my strong points as well as just. Getting along with people i love and make a great counselor people my friends come to me all the time i have a good ear for listening i'm a great mediator and i know how to because i've been through a lot. One of my friends call me the voice of reason the one that's actually graduated from sc. I know i'm like light-years ahead of a lot of people when it comes to insight and wisdom and i don't know if it has to do with you don't have an older parents myself or how i grew up or i have had very traditional southern parents who is still a lot of great value to me or if it has anything to do my astrological sign i'm a pisces but i'm. Really good with people too. Hello.. You know like i said i have my moments but i know if it's if it's something i could go into and develop i will do well. Not really some of the situations or wish i would have waited to maybe have gotten married before i had children pick a different partner. And i say that mean my son's father is great but. Okay father for my kids and i was too much as a partner for me when i see heather we haven't been together in years but i'm just saying over rothy had i. Yeah i think i would say if i could get me back track that say not finishing school when i should have and not following my dreams and goals enjoy things as i kind of was planning initially and. I think that's. That would i honestly be the one thing i could say i regret is not following my goals and i'm finishing school on time and in pursuing what i really wanted to do. Stay focus and finish school and pick a career path and stay on that and stay motivated and don't let anything or anybody to tell you. I think i'm pretty stable and consistent just with overall thing come how i faced adversity house i. Face things you know. I am a pretty committed person i try to universe and would do something to try to stick to it i'm a very loyal friend. And imma proud of the fact that i have of maintaining. Got a pretty good job with raising my kids so low. Okay. Great thank you. Bye-bye. Okay. \n",

I guess i'm kind of used to it by now so be kind of nice to explore other areas. I will draw my life having too much traveling solo. A little bit of a kind of a readiness to it. But overall it's okay. Like the computer programming and operations but that's going back to the 70s.. Analogies changed a lot as you can tell. 40 odd years. That's why that's why i was my major yeah. Arnold's kind of this kind of inquisitive it yet use your mind. You was like your brand new something you know very novel back in the. In the old days you know i'm back in the seventies now it's computers but back then i was sort of like. Something very unique. Unc to make computers around back then. And i was telling can programing so it's kind of been to the logical disavino putting together. Consulting. A particular problem he'll come up with step-by-step solutions on i guess i'll sort of back then i was kind of boring to me. Mechanical energy. And looking at the analytical in this of the year. The problem. Now i kind of facetime still use computers but i haven't gotten a bit have been in programming for a long time. Like i got into an another area kind of dip. Divorce intuit diversion to another area my life. This is going back to the er. Late seventies i kind of took another turn and by time i kind of got back into it. I kind of got into another field so i never really pursued. To the degree that i wanted to. Wow that's a good question. I never thought about that. Well actually i wanted to actually swimming with pretty simple this point in time. This is what maybe i'm kind of liking little bit depressed and then i am. At this point i kind of just wanted kind of just do a nice relaxing. Jabra b you want it somewhat of a challenge but i don't want to have to like do too much. Too much thinking it's almost the opposite of what i was back in the old days you know. I just want a nice comfortable relaxing job but i can feel fulfillment on but i don't know. 2/10 of a situation, the point in my life i just want to know. Relaxing job. Yeah. Oh i would say. Well the most park shot but once i get going i could be outgoing. I jealous because i'm a shy to begin with and then i. At times i can kind of loosen up and be more. I'll go if not i can take this to the extreme are talking too much. Like once upon gates open at the kind of. Open up too much so i have to like back off you know. But overall say i'm kind of shy is a general demeanor. Yeah. Well i listen to music. Album by watch tv. I'll. What's what would we do to relax. Why'd you start voice stressful situation so i kind of stay relaxed out to talk to my friends too. I'll be around an area. About. Have a comfort everywhere. I feel safe i can just. Dialogue with people out of my. Thinking about my own. Problem having a kind of just unifocus. I'm being in the moment with my. Friends acquaintances. I'm pretty good i don't really have a temper problem. Takes a lot to get me to to explode. In my younger days i think i was a bit more. Had a little bit slight bit of tampa never had a really bad temper but. A not really an issue i have i tend to be pretty mellow easy going. Wow that's a good question. Not sure to be honest. I didn't think about that for a long time. To be honest i can't come with an answer on that. Not really part of my repertoire. Nothing comes to mind. my head. Well. Bad investments. Back about 10 years ago. How's more. I'm trying like we're looking for her more trusting of people like that people in like them. I thought were expert in their field. And i'm. I inherited some money a little bit careless with it. And i just kind of have a vibe you know that nothing would go wrong kind of little bit of 99 tippity. And unfortunately some bad. Financial decisions constantly bad. Position for the rest of my life unfortunately because of a medical conditions i have. Talking to rebounding. You'll make it all up. Southwest financial or investment decisions. That i really regret. Wow. That's a tough one. I can't think everything about my head. Okay. Well don't really have too much family left on when i have is my. It just me and my uncle. We communicate on a regular basis. He looked but he was in clearwater florida. So we're okay. Buttom. He's like it isn't he's in his eighties and i'm out of town my my 50 so. We we do we have kind of small talk and he's kind of concerned about my well-being but it's kind of somewhat of a on a shell of us. we don't get really deep. And that he's got his own problems. So we don't really get into too deep of a conversation. Another than him it's really there's not really anybody else to have. I did that part makes me little depressed cuz i don't really feel. Have anybody i can really count on a really confide in. It is challenging i don't know why but i do have a medical condition saying that might be part of the problem. Endom. Little bit bph so. The restroom. And to the cashier question maker. Long story short. It is challenging to get a good night's being a little bit tired. Baking. But it is difficult. Well i've been feeling okay i mean. Be kind of feeling mellow actually. Find address issues that i haven't. Taking them responsibility for. I feel a bit of calmness. As of late. No. Well i did say yes tell the questionnaire and. I'm not positive it was technically diagnosed with it i did take a minute call the mmph. The minnesota multifaceted. Personality something of weather. This is going back about six months ago. They're asking me questions about my memory but then they also got into questions about my. My well-being. Psychologically too and i think some of the answers to the advice that i see a psychologist or psychiatrist. I didn't follow that. Upon that because. Philosophical differences. But i think i might have a. A mild case of depression. Well. Pakistan just kind of like kind of going along in life. I'm doing okay but you know. Highlights passing by so i haven't really fulfilled my. My goals are kind of like alone. I like to have a girlfriend i don't have a girlfriend so that's kind of. Something like you liking it close to. And i'm not really in my life right now so. A little bit of uncertainty i'm have some kind of financial uncertainties. Sowell. In overall not doing as good as i like to. Wow. That's a good one. Really happy. Let me think about that a minute. Well actually it wasn't that long ago actually i want you. Okay i know that one actually i think i'm going to answer. I thought a lady she was at a trade show. It was a anaheim has natural products esposos pretty nice wee. We have some nice meals afterwards there's a lot of exhibitors. Giving out really nice samples. It was an anaheim.zip kind of got a chance to get away from la. And. Met some interesting people are they're very outgoing they're willing to like. How many experienced their product or service. And. I was around people that. I work with who got to socialize with solo. Pretty happy back then and i was bottom. But i'm about to go. Yeah. Dallas. Best friend. Cuz i really have a best friend but. I would say. I don't know. Technically really don't have a best friend socially hardly answer that so. I can't really come with an answer. To be honest. I like to be conscientious. Yeah i do have flaws neri but i think his overall. I'm conscientious i try to be honest the most part i'm on the major issues i might know. Say what'll likewise or no. I'm not perfect i'm not going to come to the serious stuff i tend to be pretty honest i'm a hard worker i got good work ethic. Canobie. Pretty calm for the most part. Do i regret. What can you elaborate on that. Well. I just well just overall. I regret them. Not be little more assertive in my earlier. Earlier life. If i put myself in this position. It's going to take us back to my financial decisions that was sort of that sort of like my albatross in my life. I made some bad decisions and unfortunately. Going to pay the price for now so i kind of like. Sort of like. Living for the pauper existence right now which is kind of depressing. Solid say that's part of what i regret most of all. Well i would say to really you don't analyze kind of go with what you really feel. I think. Other people's opinion other people's advice. I was kind of going away from. My basic. Venus you don't like the way i really felt. Life example make you aggressive. Ingesting which if it turned out good i would be like for like win the lotto would have been well off for the rest of my life. But unfortunately it went the opposite way. Duke to my eggs in that basket. So i kind of regret it going with. My gut feeling and let other people influence me. And i was by nature i'm a conservative person so i should really do more conservative investments. Another is my life going to be more conservative but i kind of made some. Aggressive financial decision so that's pretty much. Kyle goes back to that area as far as what i regret. Wow. That's interesting. of working weekends. Well. I do like to be profitable to do something where connection. No make money that's sort of like my bread and butter time cuz you trade shows. But i'm not doing that then i'd like to maybe watch some. Go to entertainment maybe go to a ball game. Go to a movie go with some friends. It's all just kind of kick back. But my main primary primary focus will be on. Learning earning money on the weekends. Huh. That's interesting. What's prerogative. I would say that i live by and large all of the wholesome life i would say i never got myself into any kind of really. Bad. Bad. Vice. You know i. I lived a pretty wholesome wholesome life i stayed out probably. I don't really proud. Best price parts i stay the course as far as. Not going down any real deep ali so to speak. Okay. My pleasure. A pretty interesting. Is it improve your technology. Sophomore. Like you're talking to a live person sorry. It was kind of a little bit more. Academy can tell us like a more like a. Like a video game this looks more like a real. Person communicating. No not her alfredo with shrimp with some other guys and what it was but it was a little bit more. I can't reveal the details but it seemed more comfortable more natural. Yeah. \n",
      "Some just answering questions. Okay. Thank you. I'm doing fine. Time from los angeles california. Wow wonderful weather. Outdoor activities all the time. Too crowded pollution. The norm. I study child communications. Recently i just. I would say yes. Preschool teacher. Well i've always work with children ever since i was. 18 years old so i figured. Doing something helping someone it doesn't pay well but. You're investing in the future. Wow some job that i could get paid to be outside. All day. Get paid well be outside all day. Yes. I'm kind of quiet but i also like i probably would say borderline i like outside activities but i mainly kind of do. Activities probably by myself. So yeah i was having introvert. Slightly. Oh wow just maybe erases are disrespectful person. I kind of shut down and re-evaluate. How i am as a person how i'm coming off two other people i can't change anyone else's personality but i can work on my own. I'm pretty good. Are you going to argue with people i usually walk away i mean argument doesn't settle anything. Wow so out of things i regret but it's not anything that i can control probably the biggest regret was losing my mother. Thank you. I was extremely close to my mother that was. Who i am as a person who made me as a person. Wow. 2010 years ago i would tell myself not to be so angry so. Upset all the time about things i can't control i would tell myself to relax and. Not be so hard on myself. That's pretty cool i think you should have different avenues to deal with different people. No i have not. No i have not. Yes. Less than a month. I realize i have to evaluate myself as a person so i can't. Really look to anyone else to help me unless i start with myself. No i don't. I feel like. As a person as individual i feel like i should be able to control things myself i feel like. To go seek out help is good for someone else it probably is very good for other people i work with. That population of ptsd. Veterans before so i know that it helps a lot of people but i feel like it's for me. It's not difficult at all i've always been in like a loner someone who tries to to handle my own problems and situations. A little depressed but. I think everyone is it has a little bit of fatness in them at some point. Day by day day by day i just started to exercise program so i'm trying to look at myself. For the solution. Always known ever since i was a child things move me differently than other kids so i felt like. I was always different i felt like if i was going to ever. Understand. Near the person then i would have to work on myself so yes. Today i got to see my best friend after a long time so i mean happiness comes and goes but i felt happy today. Wow he would say really silly. But still when i'm around him i try to be happy. I try to present a situation where we're both going to be happy no one wants to be around a depressed person. Wow. I mean certain days everything could be my best quality but i would say. I'm loyal and dependable. I would just say i try to be there in the moment i'm not a person who who is really fat flashy or intimate realistic thing so i feel like i'm very grounded. Call my mother. By far my sisters. My mom was a school teacher which made me want to become a school teacher and that's basically what i have been doing. My sister has been at her job for 40 years so i've always had. A stable influence in my life. Wow i would say. Just sitting on a sunny nice day talking to my mother i would say that. Would bring a smile to my face immediately. Wonderful. Wonderful.

Capable. Excuse me. Intelligent. Contemplative. Deep. Nice official person. Yeah yes. Those are some of the. Many years ago. I used to have a lot of confidence i used to be a pretty dynamic person. I used to be people used to say that i was a most centered person that they knew. And i used to. Help people and now in their shoes and i don't seem to be able to help myself. I can't think of anything. Right now. I can make it really anything right now. I don't do much anything for fun anymore i used to however i'm going to movies and entertainment venues and travel. Go to dinner with friends do things. But lately i don't really have any pursuits. A good day happy day. Fun day for me is a day without. Something going wrong. Basically. Yeah. \n",
      "Who's my hair doing over there i see myself again. So this is mimicking her actual positions. Okay honey. Okay thanks. Hi hi. Sure. Alright. Originally originally i'm from korea. I-10 is a year old. Yes. Almost never ever been to korea once. I love the weather and being by the ocean and the culture. Has a lot of things to do with a food like. The traffic. It seems like. We're having a lot of. Economic difficulties in the. Parking tickets are super high. Sometimes i'm. Really annoyed by our government. By your shoes. Did he say by your shoes. Your shoes aren't showing i have traveled a bit i'm sort of traveled. I haven't traveled in a little bit little while. Oh just. It. It helps you keep things in perspective about our life here. It's exciting and it makes me feel like. Imax and really living cuz sometimes we're stuck in this bubble here in la and seeing other places you realize that. In a life is about a lot of different things that you don't think about everyday. Well. One of my trips i went. I went to. Singapore and then to thailand. And it was when i was at my ex-boyfriend and we went to. He had he was. Sales engineer. Our systems engineer but he he did well that year and so this is kind of like a company thing so we went to singapore for few days. And that was really interesting you know of course. It's a lot different over there. It's not just like going to canada or something. But they had a big reception that evening we got there and they had like a play put on by the principles of company which is real fun. After singapore leaving some tours in singapore has really. Isn't interesting experience it's really clean there and it's really. It's not like crying but the government is very it is a little bit imposing. But it was very interesting then we went to thailand and that was completely different. Like jungle. We went to. Phuket slow island. And it was just it was very. Primitive compared to. Singapore just been allotted for license very interesting it was nice. Everything is really cheap. Had a massage on the beach for $8. Who is interesting. Has an hour for $8. Well i'm in school right now. And i didn't i didn't finish school when i was younger because. Ed. Had health problems. So here i am. I'm just doing my general ed right now i'm going to smc. Yeah. Happy. Well my dream job would be. To be a veterinarian. But probably not very realistic for me at this stage in life and you know also because. Monetarily ocelot but that would be my dream job working with animals and and. And in a veterinary capacity. I think i'm right on the cusp. It depends on the environment and the people i'm with and. How comfortable i am but i'm really outgoing when i feel comfortable with people and i'll be really reserved if i'm not. What are you doing. Well i mean aside from sleeping. I like. Play relaxing things. I like going for a bike ride on the strand. Or if i'm at home. I'll just like reading your. A lot of times i can just lay there. And. My mind might be doing things but i'm kind of relaxing. I really good. I don't have. I would say there's certain things that. They can really. Like make me. Like when i see injustice has or things like that then. I mean i can really feel it. But i never just like slap a handle or throw things are. You know yell. Arguments i mean just like a disagreement or an actual argument. Like if we just. Well. I would say last summer. When. I think it was after a. Baseball game there's a group of vaseline when. Add to. We went to have shabu-shabu after the game. And. I think. And it's kind of a tenuous. Friendship like. She's a good friend in some ways and she's were rested kind of distant in other way so i don't consider her. Like someone that i would confide in and you know it was any. The problems but. Sometimes. We just have. She's very touchy. And. She's had the same sense of humor i do. I think. She had said something to me. During the night which kind of bother me but. Piano i just kind of. That's just how she is. And then i guess i said some things that. See. Spell were. Really. Offended easily i think but after that we didn't talk for a while but then we. Then one day she called me up and then we're friends again. But like she never has never confronted me. Hardest decision. It was leaving my ex-boyfriend. Well. It wasn't. It was a long time coming i mean i was thinking about it. For like 5 years. You know he wasn't like beating me or anything he's a really good guy but we just. Helados. We weren't always on the same wavelength. And we did have a lot of like disagreements. So i had thought about it and thought about it. We already engaged but we've been together for a long time so. I don't know. I was always is always on my mind like. Should i get married or should i not and then finally. How weird is always having. We're always went with the word i'm looking for. We were just having these little snippy. Disagreements all the time and then one day we had one and i just decided that i was going to leave and. I did. It was really hard it was. It was the hardest. Decision of my life and i can say that definitively. And. But i think it was for the best. Probably leaving my job. For well to help my friend start a business in nevada. And when i when i. I really like my job i mean it was pretty good. Who's right over at the beach. And when i told him that i was leaving and they offered me this. Huge raise and they offered me in a different position which is awesome. And that was really stressful for me because. I already promised my friends have to leave i wouldn't have gotten the position you know offer. If it wasn't. For her wanting me to come over there. It was really really stressful and i stress over it for about three weeks until i actually laughed. And i'm. When i went over there. Like we had we had made agreements about how much they were going to pay me and blah blah blah. When i got there everything like she didn't remember telling me that i needed a certain amount sand. The other principles of the company were. You know. It is a hard situation cuz she had she had talked with me but they hadn't talked with me and they're like oh that's too much. And also. They were a different religion. And it was very strange they are all when i was i was surrounded by mormons and i don't have anything against mormons but it was very different because. I was kind of an outsider there and then. Also the weather was just it was absolutely awful there. So i would say that's one decision if. It just a pivotal point in my life and i think that. I really wish i had just stayed. Well if you can erase something from my memory then i would probably say. Memory. Like really if if i could erase something from my memory what would i want to erase. I think of anything. I mean. Even like that. That bad. Decision that i made. You know it has value in it so. I can't really say that i would want something erasing maybe if i was like raped or something. And it was really horrifying then i would but i don't. Well if your timeouts. Being in a deep sleep i'm in a deep sleep. A lot but. I never feel rested and that's. It's a medical problem of mine. Well i always. Feel. Like i haven't slept for two days. And. There are points in in the day. I would stay in during some days there are points in the day where i really feel alert and alive and. And rested but their short-lived. But i sleep a lot. I sleep. Pretty crappy physically pretty crappy. No thanks. Now. I haven't been officially diagnosed with depression but. That's. That's usually what doctors. Like my sleeping problem hasn't been diagnosed i'm i'm in the process of really working to get it diagnosed. But that's the first thing that they try and. Figure out they they've given me like depression drugs before but they haven't helped with my sleep. But i do. I do. I would say i feel down. Sometimes. My life is very strange right now so there are a lot of reasons to feel down. I would say that i do feel down sometimes. A lot of time. But it's not. I would say. Is reasonable considering. The situations that i'm in. Are there just triggered by that my house is. Is not great and it makes it makes life really difficult. But. I wouldn't say it's triggered by anything in particular. Hello there i mean. You mean for a long. of time or i mean i i experience happiness like when i go out with friends or i go and you know i've. Find some great new dish i like i mean what type of happiness are you looking for. Well. I mean right now. My friend just had surgery and so i'm staying with her this week. I'm really enjoying it i mean even though. We could never live together i can never live with live with her long-term and i'm sure she couldn't live with me long-term but i'm having fun and. You know she just she installed the groupon app on her on her phone. Yesterday. Cuz she's been paying too much for laser hair removal. And so he installed it on her phone and then today she's. She's looking up cupcakes. So she had me pick up cupcakes on the way here to bring back to her. So i mean. You know there's little fun things like that. Probably. Ocd. And. Probably thinks i'm pretty prissy compared to her. I think that she would. Say that have a good heart. I'm very different. It probably that i am. I should ask her. I know we go out so i think she say that i'm fine. But. She has mentioned that i'm i'm a very private person and. That i know i've been ooh before she said that. Why. What i told you i have i have a lot of problems right now. And. So i don't really. Tell people about them. It is kind of a. Kind of a killjoy but also. People can feel i feel that people can feel. Less comfortable if. They perceive that you have a have difficulties and they feel kind of. It's just uncomfortable like oh they maybe they should help her they feel guilty but they have busy lives so just kind of traits of gap but i would say even before. Even before this difficult time in my life. I've been. I put a private person. I don't know why. I think a lot. You know i'm a deep thinker. And. Maybe it's a. In-n-out. Not like i feel like i feel abnormal but. Maybe i just have a lot of thoughts it. None seemed doesn't seem appropriate to share with people or. Not sure. Are 20 years ago. Well one thing that i regret right now is. Yeah i haven't really found. Somebody. You got to spend the rest of my life with. So i would tell myself to concentrate more on that cuz once i hit 40 it's it's it's a lot harder. I would say. That i persevered. I'm very proud it. Even though i have. A lot of. Difficulties in my life. The fact that i'm. You know making this commitment to go to school. And i'm doing on my own. And. You know it's. It's kind of a. If people. If people knew all the problems today have maybe like lowell. You know why are you worried about school but. I really feel that. You know i'm. I'm doing this and i'm really proud that even through everything. And getting a. Okay. Hi. \n",
      "Lassie's pretty fashionable. Okay. Yes. Very well. Ohio. Finish school came out to start my life. Not often now. Not really often. All because my parents have both passed away and so that's my reason for that was my reason for going home. Prior. I've just really not a comparison. You know this is warm and. Sunny. And that has four seasons so it's a very different environment. I it took a minute. To get adjusted to the different culture. But after i was suggested you know the sunshine keeps you here. I love the weather. I love the fact that i have the ocean and the mountains. And somebody thinks that i can choose from and the diversity that i find here. Can to not have things that i don't. Like. Because where i am i know that i'm finding myself there. So and i like me so that means that there's really nothing i don't like. Yes i do. I love being able to explore different cultures be able to meet different people have a different set of experiences and at the same time to be able to find the commonality between. All types of people. The very rich experience. Which one. To where. Guess i'm thinking about egypt. And the wonderful experiences that i have there. A vigo. The people and the. Warm and living experience i have the knowledge i get to pursue. Through the. Exploring the temples and pyramids excetera things like that. There are so many there really are. But i can think of. Seen a baby in a mosque. Which was just really pure and it. Really. Stay with me how similar we actually all our. That's probably one of the things that i remember most from one of my very first trips. Are there. And. Footsie. Just be interaction of the people food you know incredible i love the food to. Wow i study lots of different things that studied law i studied. Entertainment i studied communications i've studied. Whatever i want to play the renaissance woman. It's just always been my way to really explore all of the things that i enjoy. Keeps me fresh keeps me happy keeps me alive. And just allows me to be able to. Be fully developed as a human being being able to do that. I don't have a dream job. Per say what i do have is a. Desire to just be able to be free to do whatever it is that i choose. On a daily basis. So. Probably more outgoing. Well i start my day out there relax because i start my day with meditation and. Several other spiritual practices that i perform. Before i move around i get exercise. So that i keep everything humming everything moving. And then move forward from there. That's what i don't really have one anymore. Argued. Cannot remember the last time that i actually had an argument. $10 about. I imagine the last and i argued about something related to money. Situation i wish i'd handled differently. You know i try to take each experience as they. Come and try not to have regrets. To help guilt about the way anything. All went because they're all for me very positive learning experiences. That i get to explore who i am through so i don't really see them as. Needing them to be different i need to learn from them or to just really accept what is. Hardest decision i've ever had to make. Don't really have a hard decision. You know because i grew up and away. Aware but mother was extremely. Wonderful and the way that she always taught me to know that it was my own life and so she would never make decisions for me she always taught me to say she would always say. It's your life. And so for me this is don't really come. As difficult to make. They're pretty easy to make because i've been making them since childhood. I don't really have a. Most difficult. Decision i've ever made. Event that i could erase from my memory i don't really have one that i can think of that would be so terrible that i would need to. Erase it again everything for me is a learning experience so there's nothing really to regret or erase. A very easy soon as i hit the pillow i'm out. Great a little more. Physical exertion then normal. But still great. No not overall but again i attributed that knife read that too. The spiritual practices that i perform on a daily basis they keep me pretty even-tempered. No. No. Tell me about the. That's pretty much every day. I feel really happy everyday i'm thankful i'm grateful. For my life and i'm just thankful for everything that comes into it. Very smart. Oh. Very loving very intelligent. Funny. Outgoing. It's probably probably what my friends would say. There's really nothing that i'd think i need. Heading to do or to have her to be different about myself. Like i'm okay with everything the way it is. Really am. What advice would have given myself 10 or 20 years ago. To know. To understand that everything that happened 10 or 20 years ago. Was important in terms of developing the person that i am now. And. So to just be able to go with the flow and go with the experiences of life. In order to be able to. Learn how to move effortlessly through any situation that comes up. Recently really enjoyed. Cooked a very wonderful meal. Cuz i love cooking. Something i really enjoy. Wow my my willingness to get to know myself. Through travel through exploration through practices and through the practical application. Of everything that i've learned about people cultures. Places most importantly you know. The god within me. Bye. Seabreeze i c. \n",
      "That i am. Alright thank you so much rachel. Sure. Fine i'm doing alright. Yeah. From maryland. Yeah. Maryland washington dc area. I like 5 weeks ago. Maryland. It's a lot it's a lot less. It's not as nice this time of year it's more. It's it's good it's nice it's. La's a lot better though it's a lot. More people out more going on. I guess i'm still getting used to it so. It's. It's not like. Yeah i'm still getting used to it it's. Coming slowly but but surely. I live in culver city. I do have one. It's okay it's i live in a really nasty house it's me it's cheap it's cheap cuz i'm living in a friend's place. And. But but and he's letting me stay there for half price but that the actual like place itself is pretty. Horrible living conditions. But i'm moving soon so. I can't see your shoes actually. But no i i travel meet i said meant by probably traveled more than most people in the us like considering that most people don't travel in the us but i wouldn't. I wouldn't call myself a world traveler and. Enjoy the chance to get to like see other. Walks of life and and and kind of like. Meditate on the. The specificity of my own. You know the the the. Given the parameters that i grew up under like how different everyone else's like how every life is totally i mean even just within the us like seeing how someone in california grows up is so different from how someone in. Maryland grows up and then to think about someone in lie. Thailander something growing. Freemason. Okay. Put me on the spot here ali. Let's say. Well i. It's been awhile since i've been on a trip i guess. One of the last trips i did was to. I made a lot like two years ago i went on a road trip across the us and that was that was pretty amazing saw. But i guess the best put the best two places on the drive from maryland to la this is before i actually moved out here but i visited new orleans and new orleans was just this whole like even though it's part of the us it's like a totally. It's totally different than anywhere else so. Unique the culture they are so unique and. And the blend of like caribbean in french and all these other influences into like the american south is so. So. Yeah it's just it's. Yeah it's unreal. Tough question. What. Can you come back to that question are you capable of that. Combative. Film. You know that's actually a question i've been asking myself i knew i know. At my entire life i've had like phases of interest so and i was like very very very young i was really into like. First phase that i remember was keys and then tools like a girl around collecting keys. And i go around collecting to like just every source why the toolbox. My parents have told me that i had to face before that with which was balls. Like various balls. Then i was really into like insects collecting insects and reptiles. And said like animals in that. The dinosaur phase-in. At a certain point i got really into. Like rat like music like forever strap and then guitar and then acting and then it's some point in there i i i remember telling someone that right now i'm interested in. Play writing and and poetry but eventually i was going to be interested in in. Film. I could kind of see the trajectory coming but i don't remember what led me to that conclusion i think i just always. Lettuce sheltered life as far as movies are concerned i didn't. My parents didn't let me see an r-rated movie until i was like in high school almost like. And. And i never. Sign everytime i rated movie i was also very squeamish like i remember when i was. Fairly young maybe like 6 i saw star wars. The first seen it. star wars darth vader cracked like breaks his neck. That just a little scene very very very beginning. And that like freaked me out and i had to leave the room. So. I'm not really sure. Yeah it's tits it's. I'm not exactly sure how i got into film. But. I've always been fascinated by like. How people interact and what like. You know acting. Stop something movies in general. I am yes. To be a filmmaker to be able to direct. And put together. And like i could. Direct. Use that word so much cuz i think i think of it more as like i want the opportunity to put together and make. Movies. Where to make movies. It's probably the best way to do it to say it cuz i want you and i want involvement and all the. All the process. I guess the best parable for that would be a director. Well it's a lot better when i'm not living with them. My. I guess. Funny you should ask. I've been thinking about it a lot lately i think i'm close in my entire family on closest with my dad. I get along with my brother and sister you know like but i don't. Went away. Like my brothers in a foreign country right now so i don't have the opportunity to talk with him but like. I spend more time talking to my dad than anyone else cuz i feel like he's the most like. Of all my family he's the one who most. Accept me in like. Think positively about me. I have like a. A complicated relationship. Eminem my family in general. Well on the meijer. Briggs personality test i'm i'm an extrovert but like since moving but i'm not like. I'm not i probably we consider myself on the scheme of extraversion or on the scale of extraversion sorry i would consider myself extremely introvert. I just i see other extroverts in just a matter who they're around there a little like strike up conversations in a fairly shy person them sort of like. Or inhibited person maybe. So i like to like. Until. Yeah but i'm working on it i'm working on it. In the past i would smoke weed. But quit smoking. So now i do not have a glass of wine and. Maybe watch a movie. I don't have or maybe go like depending if it's like an. If it's. If it's a worn out. Sort of. Stress like i'm like. That i that's what i do but if it's more like anxious type stress i might. Go out on an intense walk. Don't really exercise that much but i like. In a competitive sports and hiking. Pretty good. Well i always like arguing. I wouldn't call arguing this to losing my temper. I enjoy a vicious debate. But i don't. As long as my like. Cuz i want like revert to personal. You know attacks. In my in my arguments i try to keep it on subject. And try to explain myself as best i can which can get frustrating cuz i'm not like the best. Articulator of what i think. More my weaker points i would say. But the last time i had a heated debate i think that was not the question. What happened i forgot i forgot the question that that i had a heated debate. Last time i had a heated debate. Was. I had a heated debate about. The movie boogie nights. I didn't lose my temper exactly but i got like very extremely passionate about about. That i don't think it's like that good of a movie but the two people who i was i was arguing with her saying that it was like one of the. Like best. Best movies. Why did they think it was the best movie. They think that like there's something there's some sort of. As i understand it they have. They have a certain. They think that the. Take all of the stories within boogie nights they have their own like each of them could be their own separate stories they just think that there's a whole lake. Complexity of character. Within the movie. And. But somehow like. What were they saying they were saying like. The movie. It's like it's like the end of an era. Where's makes it look kind of like casino and there's this attention to detail of of the in the different character like how they. How they interact in the plot. Kind of like. Yeah i guess. I think the heated debate became about like that so from there and like personally it's not like a bad movie or anything but it's. The. I just don't think dirk diggler is like that like me meaningful of a character like. I guess the way i come out i came out of the movie cuz i had seen it before many years ago in at my opinion of it is basically the same even though like i remember like. In watching it again i was able to re-evaluate it. There's nothing bad about the movie there's nothing like articulable about this lisa's solid acting directing is good the camera moves are cool. Every email it's cool it's but. But it's meat for me is like meaningless and then two and then they were that let us to discuss to the movie that i saw i recently that i really did like was django unchained and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie. And then there was this extreme i guess the heated part of the conversation came about like. So in the movie django unchained. If django and jango's like it kind of is a two-dimensional character but i don't think that that necessarily takes away from what the. The big. Big purpose of the movie is. And. And you have dr. king schultz who's this. Who's this like his mentor character and the person i was arguing with with saying that he. Was intelligent and so in because he was intelligent there's no way he would have risked his life to save django. Or like would have gone into this like second act. Where they go and they go to the. Plantation to deceive django's wife excetera. And. And the reason for her giving that argument which like either you buy that he would do that or a wouldn't but the reason for her argument is that an intelligent person would not. Sacrificed himself for someone else. Which strike which strikes me as so like. Like who. Like. She she her bit her basic argument was that. Like altruism destiny cuz it was a very high and ran type arguing altruism doesn't exist. The only the only thing you can do is sit like the only thing people do is serve themself. So it's not quite ironman but it's like the only thing that people like all people are out to serve himself which i'm not arguing that like. Every decision has like a mix of altruism in and something like even the most altruistic type decision there's maybe like kernels of self stuff interest in there but she made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor. In an inn like what but what how how horrible is your life if that's like what your ultimate. Like if you can't like love and sacrifice for other people so it loaded to an extremely passionate debate. And. Summit like yeah it is. So so yeah that that i guess that's the i don't think i necessarily like lost my temper. I think i'm losing my temper is being more. Like i just. I would. Revert to ad hominem like attacks. But i didn't like that tonight. Maybe i was like maybe i was criticizing her worldview but it i wasn't like. What you're an idiot. You know like it wasn't it didn't it didn't turn into abuse of any sort. Yeah. I'm glad you understand. An event or i don't know if i necessarily would. Want to erase anything from my memory i would say an issue that i have is not being able to remember in as much detail as i would like to remember. Feelings and moments not. Stories. Like my life doesn't always think together until like a coherent story it's like this moment in that moment in this moment in that. The hardest decision i've ever had to make. Fauci. Could it just be one of the hardest decisions. Choosing between two things that it's like. I guess. I'm having a hard time recalling a moment where i like had to choose between. Two options like no there's no like sophie's choice type moment in my life. Play but i do think that the decision cuz i lived in new york for a while i went to school in new york and the decision to leave new york after having lived there for five years was it was very very difficult. And but i had to do it. For money reasons and because all of my all of my core group of friends. Worry they're like we're muslim we're leaving and going other places in the world. And then the one other person was close to was living with someone who i did not get along with it all. So is like this situation why didn't. Is it going to live with people who i wasn't as close with or craigslist or or move home and i think. It was a tough decision to to leave the only way i could do it i had to justify it by saying that i would be moving back. To new york with in like a month or two. Which wasn't which didn't end up happening but that was the only way that i could. Leave new york. It was how hard was that. Or how hard is. How hard was. It's hard. Yeah but still it's just a very like. Isolating ice. Cuz those are like i'd felt like previously to that time i'd fallen in love with one of my. Like closest another one of my close very close friends. And. That had kind of gone extremely. Badly. And so i wasn't on speaking terms with her and i couldn't like that hole. Everyone on my list of friends who was like closer to her her it was quite like. Hermie type thing but that. That was the way that i kind of. Saw it at the time so i didn't like. You know just being socially isolated. Recently it's been awful. I like to see the last last night i slept like 10 and a half hours. Which seems to be the length of time that i have to sleep in order to have really vivid dreams. Previous to that night. So last. Not last night but the night before last and the night before that i got four hours in 2 hours of sleep. Because i was working on sat and i would get back. And either and i just like couldn't fall asleep for whatever reason it's. Too much riled-up energy or something i don't know. Tired. Very. Not immediately i guess initially upon waking up like i did really enjoy being up in the early morning. And i also stopped drinking caffeine like i've had like a little bit of coffee the last two days but before the last two days i hadn't had any coffee in like three and a half weeks so. I guess. With with caffeine in my system i'm ready to i'm ready to go. Without caffeine it's. I'm just i'm just quieter i guess. More introverted. Since lake lately is in latin. Changing my thoughts. Yeah i mean i guess when having just moved here there was a. of time like. At the beginning where the. The sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people. they moved here cuz i have a group of friends here or couple of friends. I don't have like a large number of friends. And that. The push to. To get out there and meet people and find a job in. That sort of pressure. Pretty. Overwhelming at first and i think that i'm slowly like. Coming to terms with that. And moving you no moving past it at but it's still it's still there the pressures there but i'm just. You know. Unit you know you know. No i just. The last time i felt really happy. Might have to reach back. I think the last time i felt really happy. Was doing the writing process of last year i shot a movie. Co-wrote co-directed co-produced. And that was kind of like that it's still consumes my life but. But i think that during the. Writing stages of that movie in which we would but like get up eat breakfast. Bunker down work really hard put stuff up on the thing just like pure creative. Energy between me and the person riding it and. And there is like probably like a good day that i remember where it's just i remember going to bed and i was just so thrilled to be working on when i was working on and and and working with the person i was working within like. Just like. I felt like it yeah i guess that was the. The last time that was that was like. More than a year ago though but i guess it's hard to hard to think that i haven't been really truly happy since then but when you're making a movie like. You don't you can't allow yourself to be happy. Especially if you're doing it. Yeah basically by yourself with with like. I can't be like you can't. Too much else to do. I would say that i'm very. Except like. Accepting of other people. And always. Varian. Empathic. And. Open like. Excited about new ideas and open to new ideas and. Yeah. I guess i wish i was last. Less ruled by fear more more fearless in my. You know. Everyday interactions and in my like. You know. Zest for for living. Yai. I got other things i would change about myself. I would. I don't know. Really badly about my. I need a renewed numerous instances in my childhood in which my like. Like every single time there was an issue at school or some sort of. Some sort of. Conflict with a teacher or anything my parents were always. Always on the other side of the court you know like never. It was i noticed. Or noticed as i got older that other people other parents were. Look at their kid was in trouble like. There's something wrong with. With. Like their kid was perfect there's nothing wrong with other people. But my parents were it was always the opposite in particular my mom. Science editor couple of instances in which. I was like blamed her like you know. It was my was my fault. When. When what i was doing it like. Yes things things that i couldn't like. No yeah i don't know. Yeah. 10 years ago. Stay stay kina like i i think that there is. I have a tendency to. Like i'd love the fact that i have a tendency to get really caught up in id and then idea in like devote myself entirely to it but sometimes. Ideas are too easily decided to say like do as much as possible like. Don't. Don't decide that you. Are only going to do. One thing like. I guess i would have taken up like some taking piano learn learn to read music would be a big thing for me learn to play the drums. What event drums more than reading music i would say i'd love to learn how to play the drums and maybe done more like acting classes. As far as like cuz i was always really into directing so he's directing actors and stuff but i didn't. It's only now that i i don't know i guess. Stay. Don't stay stay yeah i don't know that's a tough tough tough question la. That's it. Sure. Goodbye. Alright. \n"
